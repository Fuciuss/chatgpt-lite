     <h2>
      Annual leave when employment ends
     </h2>
     <p>
      When employment ends, employers have to pay their employee for any unused annual leave they've accumulated during their employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual leave payment has to be the same amount that the employee would have received if they’d taken the annual leave during their employment. For example, if an employee would have been entitled to annual leave loading or other payments when they took their annual leave, these loadings and other payments have to be included in the final payment. These payments apply even if an award, registered agreement or employment contract says that they don’t.

      Annual leave when sick or injured
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employee is sick or injured while on annual leave, the employee can use their paid sick or carer's leave entitlement instead of using their annual leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer can still request the employee provide notice and evidence when taking sick or carer's leave while on annual leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer can’t direct an employee to take annual leave while they’re taking sick or carer’s leave.
