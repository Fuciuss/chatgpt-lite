      The Fair Work Ombudsman will audit up to 200 businesses throughout western
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      as part of a new campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will check that employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances, loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign will focus on businesses located in and around
      <strong>
       Merrylands
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Guildford
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Fairfield
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Parramatta
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Mount Druitt
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers from a range of sectors will be included, such as manufacturing, road freight transport, carpentry, building and industrial cleaning, computer system design, cafes and restaurants, investigation and security, childcare, hairdressing and beauty, and employment placement and recruitment.
     </p>
     <p>
      All businesses will be randomly selected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says western Sydney is home to thousands of businesses and the Agency receives a constant stream of requests for assistance from employees across the western suburbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It's important we check workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsmanâ€™s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, an Online learning centre and My Account, which enables employers and employees to save information on pay and conditions for their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit the website or call the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      . An interpreter service is available on
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses calling the Infoline can opt to receive priority service to assist with their inquiries.
