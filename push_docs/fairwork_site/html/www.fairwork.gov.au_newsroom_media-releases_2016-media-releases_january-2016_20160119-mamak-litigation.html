      <strong>
       19 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of an inner
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      restaurant are facing Court for allegedly short-changing six employees tens of thousands of dollars and using false records to try to disguise the underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The six casual staff, all from non-English speaking backgrounds, worked at the Mamak Malaysian restaurant on Goulburn Street at
      <strong>
       Haymarket
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      They were allegedly paid flat rates as low as $11 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five of the six were visa-holders when they commenced work at Mamak – four international students and one employee on a bridging visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were allegedly collectively underpaid a total of $87,349 between February, 2012 and April, 2015. All outstanding entitlements have since been reimbursed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against restaurant owner-operators Joon Hoe Lee, Julian Lee and Alan Wing-Keung Au and their company Mamak Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      One employee was allegedly underpaid a total of $26,793 and another $21,538.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Restaurant Industry Award, five adult employees should have been paid more than $22 for normal hours and a junior employee more than $13.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors were allegedly provided with false records that made it appear that higher rates had been paid to one employee than was actually the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Laws relating to pay-slips and providing employees with workplace access to information about minimum lawful entitlements were also allegedly contravened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Restaurant owners Joon Hoe Lee, Julian Lee and Alan Wing-Keung Au all face maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Mamak Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking an injunction restraining the owners - who also operate Mamak Malaysian restaurants at
      <strong>
       Chatswood
      </strong>
      , in Sydney, and in the
      <strong>
       Melbourne CBD
      </strong>
      – from contravening workplace laws in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the Agency has requested Court Orders for them to undertake training on workplace relations laws and to commission an audit of their compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for February 5 in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
