      <strong>
       16 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A Taiwanese-registered manufacturing corporation which makes and installs animal feed mills in regional NSW will face court for failing to co-operate with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court  against Chia Tung Development Corp Ltd and its director Michael Chen-Fa Lin.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the second time the Agency has taken enforcement action against the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legal action follows Chia Tung's failure to comply with a formal Compliance Notice requiring a $61,910 back-payment of two Filipino visa-holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      , business operators must adhere to Compliance Notices or make a Court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice was issued on January 8 and sought rectification by January 22.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chia Tung did not meet the deadline, alleging that Australian workplace law did not apply to the workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Filipino workers were in Australia on a subclass 400 short-stay business visa between December, 2013 and August, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that the two were paid a set monthly amount in US dollars, which was then converted to Philippine pesos, and equated to about $A4.90 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chia Tung allegedly did not pay the workers minimum rates, overtime or penalties for Sundays, public holidays and for work undertaken on a rostered day off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Annual leave and leave loading on termination was also allegedly not paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chia Tung is already subject to an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman signed in March 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EU followed an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman into its employment of 43 workers on 457 visas between September, 2014, and February, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Action by the Fair Work Ombudsman ensured a back-payment of more than $870,000 for the workers, also visa-holders from The Philippines and China. See the

      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recently had a number of successes in court proceedings against operations which failed to comply with Compliance Notices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell says the Agency prefers to assist employers to rectify non-compliance issues, but is prepared to take legal action against employers who refuse to co-operate.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Building a culture of compliance with workplace law is important, and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate," Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The integrity of the system must be upheld."
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the Agency is working hard to ensure a level playing field for employers who are doing the right thing and meeting their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are committed to helping employers understand and comply with workplace laws, but operators need to make an effort to get the basics right in the first place," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      He says Fair Work inspectors identifying issues in a workplace generally find that most employers are co-operative, engaging and willing to receive advice and assistance to rectify their mistakes and ensure future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      "But we will take a dim view of those who give us the cold shoulder and refuse to work with us when we are trying to get to the bottom of an issue."
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell reminded employers that there are minimum wage rates and entitlements and they apply to everyone, including visa holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost 12 per cent of all requests for assistance came from visa-holders last financial year and the Agency recouped $1.6 million for underpaid visa-holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about their workplace practices to visit the website at www.fairwork.gov.au or phone the Fair Work Infoline on
