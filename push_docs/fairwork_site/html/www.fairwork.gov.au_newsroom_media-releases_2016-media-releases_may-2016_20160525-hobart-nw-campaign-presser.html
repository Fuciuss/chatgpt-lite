       Spot checks of 50 employers north-west of Hobart have found almost three-quarters are fully compliant with their obligations under federal workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the finding is encouraging.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors began assessing businesses in response to an increase in requests from assistance from employees in the north-west suburbs.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Auditing was carried out across a range of industry sectors, including restaurants and cafes, automotive repairs, hairdressers, retail shops and road freight transport.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Almost half were located in
       <strong>
        Moonah
       </strong>
       , almost a quarter in
       <strong>
        Glenorchy
       </strong>
       , and the remainder in
       <strong>
        Derwent Park, Goodwood, Battery Point
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Margate.
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Businesses were scrutinised to assess their compliance with minimum wage rates, overtime and weekend penalty rates, allowances, and pay-slip and record-keeping obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says 72 per cent were compliant with all their requirements, 86 per cent paid their employees correctly and 84 per cent met record-keeping and pay-slip obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, seven businesses were found to have errors with pay-slips and records, six paid incorrect wage rates and one breached both wages and pay-slip requirements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Five employers were asked to repay $2526 to 10 employees who had been short-changed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Businesses found to be non-complaint will be re-audited as part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s National Compliance Monitoring Campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James noted that businesses which were members of an employer or industry association had higher compliance rates than non-members.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She says one of the aims of the campaign was to ensure employers were aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
      </span>
