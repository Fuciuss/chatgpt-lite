      <strong>
       25 October 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An Australian fishing company and its director have been penalised a total of almost $50,000 for underpaying four Indonesian crew tens of thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fishing company – formerly called Australian Wild Tuna Pty Ltd and recently renamed Stella Del Mare Pty Ltd – has received a $43,200 penalty after admitting it underpaid the four employees, who were in Australia on 457 skilled worker visas, a total of $43,481.
     </p>
     <p>
      Company director and manager Angelo Maiorana, of Sydney, has been penalised a further $5120 for his role in the underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties, imposed in the Federal Circuit Court, are the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Nicholas Manousaridis ordered that part of the penalties be paid to the underpaid workers, who have been only partially back-paid, to rectify any entitlements that remain outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the penalties send a message that there are serious consequences for exploiting overseas workers in Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We treat underpayment of overseas workers particularly seriously because they can be vulnerable if they are unaware of their rights or reluctant to complain,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The four underpaid employees - three deckhands and an engineer – worked on two tuna fishing vessels, the
      <em>
       Santo Rocco
      </em>
      and the
      <em>
       Challenge
      </em>
      , in waters off the east coast between Sydney and Queensland’s Sunshine Coast between July, 2012 and June, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       The Santo Rocco
      </em>
      primarily docked in NSW and the
      <em>
       Challenge
      </em>
      primarily docked in Queensland.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments, individually ranging from $7113 to $12,604, were primarily the result of a regular failure to pay employees’ minimum wages and unlawful deductions from wages. Record-keeping and pay slip laws were also contravened.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments persisted over a significant period, with Maiorana promising employees that when company financial difficulties were resolved their outstanding wages would be paid in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Manousaridis found that as time went on, Maiorana acted unreasonably in believing that he would be able to pay any shortfall in wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Manousaridis said the underpayments were significant and the company’s financial difficulties were no excuse for failing to pay the employees their full lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty imposed should “signal to the community not only the importance of employers complying with their obligations to pay the correct amount of wages; it should also signal the importance of employers complying with such obligations even at times when the employer's business faces financial stress,” Judge Manousaridis said.
