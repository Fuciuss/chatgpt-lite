      <strong>
       9 January 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An underpaid truck driver in Northern Queensland has been back-paid $52,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker - who is aged in his 60s and was employed at a transport business near
      <strong>
       Cairns -
      </strong>
      was underpaid the minimum hourly rate and travel allowance entitlements between January 2010 and September last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the underpayment occurred because of a lack of awareness by the employer of its payment obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The underpayment was inadvertent and the employer has co-operated fully and promptly with Fair Work Inspectors, so no further compliance action has been necessary," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This case illustrates that a small inadvertent underpayment per hour, left unchecked over time, can result in a business having to make a big back-payment it was not budgeting for, so it's important employers make sure they are aware of the pay rates that apply to their staff."
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $19,100 for a foreign worker at a
       <strong>
        Cairns
       </strong>
       bakery who was underpaid wages and personal leave entitlements over a 12-month period in 2011-2012, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5600 for a tradesman at a
       <strong>
        Cairns
       </strong>
       construction business who was not paid his final wages upon termination of employment last year.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James said the employees were back-paid all money owed without the need for further action after Fair Work Inspectors contacted the businesses and explained their responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      "When we identify an error and contact a business, our focus is on educating the employer about their obligations and helping them to put processes in place to ensure future compliance, and thatâ€™s what we did in these cases," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said employers should take advantage of the free help available from the Fair Work Ombudsman if they are unsure of their payment obligations.
