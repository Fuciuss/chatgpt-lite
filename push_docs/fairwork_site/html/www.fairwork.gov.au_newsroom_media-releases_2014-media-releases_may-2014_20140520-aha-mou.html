     <p>
      Thousands of hotels, resorts, taverns, wine bars, liquor retailers, casinos and other hospitality businesses are joining forces with the Fair Work Ombudsman to improve compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Australian Hotels’ Association has signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of its 5000 members aimed at creating and maintaining fair workplaces and a level playing field for employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell, who co-signed the MoU with AHA chief executive officer Stephen Ferguson, announced details of the new agreement in
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell and the Fair Work Ombudsman Executive Director of Dispute Resolution and Compliance, Steve Ronson, are attending the AHA’s Northern Territory Employment Relations Conference.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the second MoU between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the AHA and was struck after an initial agreement signed in 2010 expired.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell welcomed the AHA’s ongoing commitment to collaboration and exchange of information, saying it was pleasing the two parties would continue to work together to promote and achieve workplace compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will provide advice to the AHA about how it can assist its members to meet their workplace obligations as employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The AHA has agreed to apprise the Fair Work Ombudsman of any problems faced by the industry that can act as barriers to compliance. The two parties will work together to devise appropriate solutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This second MoU highlights the AHA’s commitment to making compliance with workplace laws a high priority across the industry,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The AHA acknowledges there are always opportunities for improvement and is actively seeking out those opportunities for its members.”
     </p>
     <p>
      AHA chief executive officer Stephen Ferguson says he was pleased to be able to sign up to a further three-year agreement on behalf of his members.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We look forward to continuing to work constructively with the Fair Work Ombudsman on issues of mutual interest and advancing fair and productive Australian workplaces within our industry,” Mr Ferguson said.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the agreement, the Fair Work Ombudsman has appointed a dedicated member of staff to work with AHA representatives and respond to industry needs.
     </p>

      The Fair Work Ombudsman website - www.fairwork.gov.au - has resources to assist employers.
