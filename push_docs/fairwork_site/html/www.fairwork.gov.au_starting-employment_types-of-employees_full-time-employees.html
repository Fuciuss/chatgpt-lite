     <p>
      A full-time employee is usually entitled to written notice when their employment ends, or payment instead of notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The actual hours of work for a full-time employee in a particular job or industry are agreed between the employer and the employee. They could also be set by an

      Fixed term contract employees are employed for a specific period of time or task. For example, a 6 month contract where employment ends after 6 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fixed term employees are different to permanent employees who are employed on an ongoing basis until the employer or employee ends the employment relationship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fixed term contract employees are usually full-time or part-time employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Full-time or part-time fixed term employees are generally entitled to the same wages, penalties and leave as permanent employees. An award or registered agreement may provide extra terms and conditions for a fixed term employee.

     <h3>
      When the employer and the employee agree to change
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employee and an employer may agree to end an employee’s full-time position and change to part-time or casual employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      When changing from full-time or part-time to casual the usual rules for ending employment apply, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       giving or paying the employee the required notice
      </li>
      <li>
       paying out leave and any other entitlements owed.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      When the employee doesn’t agree to change
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employer may be able to change an employee’s full-time employment to part-time or casual employment without agreement from the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Important factors to consider are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       does the employment contract,
       <a data-href="/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2034" href="/taxonomy/term/407">
        registered agreement
       </a>
       or award let the employer change the employee’s work hours without the employee agreeing?
      </li>
      <li>
       does the change make a new employment contract or change an existing contract?
      </li>
      <li>
       what entitlements, such as annual leave or redundancy, need to be paid out?
      </li>
      <li>
       how much notice does the employer need to give the employee?
      </li>
