      The Fair Work Ombudsman has again secured a penalty against a former Victorian petrol station operator, this time for ignoring an Order to pay compensation to an unfairly dismissed employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has imposed a $20,000 fine against Wedderburn Petroleum Pty Ltd, which formerly operated a petrol station at 117 High Street,
      <strong>
       Wedderburn
      </strong>
      , north-west of Bendigo.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company contravened workplace laws by failing to comply with a Fair Work Commission Order to pay $5000 compensation to an employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission ordered the compensation payment last year after finding the employee had been unfairly dismissed in 2013 after working as a console operator and manager for more than two-and-a-half years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee turned to the Fair Work Ombudsman for help after the compensation was not paid within the required 14 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman made several requests for the company to comply with the Commission’s Order, but commenced legal action when it was not able to secure cooperation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to imposing the penalty, the Court has ordered Wedderburn Petroleum to pay the outstanding $5000 compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wedderburn Petroleum was last year fined $123,915 in Court for underpaying two other console operators a total of almost $50,000. That penalty was also the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency has an important role to play in enforcing Orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Building a culture of compliance with workplace law is important, and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Wedderburn Petroleum matter is the second Fair Work Ombudsman litigation finalised in Court relating to contraventions of a Fair Work Commission Order to pay unfair dismissal compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the other case, Melbourne company World Gym Sunshine Pty Ltd and its director Wayne George Mailing were fined almost $50,000 last year for ignoring an order to pay $2200 compensation to a young employee.
