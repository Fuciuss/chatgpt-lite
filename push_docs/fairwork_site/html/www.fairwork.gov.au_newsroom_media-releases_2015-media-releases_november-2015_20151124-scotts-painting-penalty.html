     <p>
      The operator of
      <strong>
      </strong>
      a
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      painting business has been fined $15,000 for deliberately exploiting four young overseas workers and refusing to back-pay them thousands of dollars in unpaid wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has imposed the penalty against Scott Aeron Davenport, whose business trades as Scott’s Painting Service.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the second time this month that the Court has fined a Darwin business for exploiting overseas workers in Australia on 417 working holiday visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      On November 11, the Fair Work Ombudsman announced that the former owner-operators of the Java Spice Café Emporium on Mitchell St, husband-and-wife Peter and Moya Buckley, had been fined a total of $73,000 for underpaying two Taiwanese backpackers.

        Court imposes hefty penalty to deter employers from exploiting overseas backpackers
       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman took legal action against Davenport for underpaying four French backpackers a total of $5940.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aged between 21 and 25, they performed painting and labouring duties at a local college in December, 2013 and January, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Davenport paid three of the workers just $450 for 13 days’ work, which equated to hourly rates of between $4.62 and $4.71.
     </p>
     <p>
      A fourth worker was paid $300 for five days’ work – an effective hourly rate of $11.54.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Building and Construction General On-Site Award
      </em>
      , the workers were entitled to more than $22 an hour for normal hours and over $38 an hour for weekend work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Individual underpayments ranged from $451 to $1889.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated the matter after the backpackers requested assistance from the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legal proceedings were initiated after Davenport refused to co-operate with Fair Work inspectors and failed to respond to a Notice to Produce employment documents.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Court Order earlier this year requiring Davenport to back-pay the workers in full has not been complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a minority of rogue employers need to get the message that exploitation of overseas workers is unlawful and unacceptable conduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is currently conducting a national review of the wages and conditions of overseas workers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Director of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Overseas Workers’ Team, Ms Carey Trundle, has met with key stakeholders in
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Alice Springs
      </strong>
      as part of the review to gain local intelligence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Formal allegations of non-compliance from overseas workers have increased steadily in recent years to more than 2100 last financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of these, 930 related to subclass 417 working holiday visas, 315 to 457 temporary skilled work visa-holders and 181 to international students.
     </p>
     <p>
      Allegations received from overseas workers were highest in Queensland (28 per cent); NSW (25 per cent) and Victoria (22 per cent).
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of $1.6 million was recovered for visa-holders in 2014-15, up from $1.1 million the previous financial year.
