      A free online learning course that offers advice about promoting good staff performance and effectively addressing underperformance can help employers boost the productivity of their businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that employers who establish effective performance management systems can reap significant benefits from a happy, motivated and better-performing workforce.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Conversely, failing to address an individual employee’s underperformance appropriately and sensitively can lead to unhealthy and unproductive outcomes that can also impact on co-workers, customers and the business,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “While there is no legislative obligation for workplace performance to be managed in a certain way, this new course gives employers valuable advice about simple steps they can take to get the best out of their employees.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s new course,
      <em>
       Managing Performance
      </em>
      , takes about 25 minutes to complete and is available in the Agency’s Online Learning Centre at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <em>
       Promoting Good Performance
      </em>
      part of the course advises employers on establishing a performance system that sets clear goals and expectations for employees and provides a framework for ongoing feedback and discussion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Topics covered include creating a performance template for the workplace, meeting with employees to develop a performance agreement, monitoring employee performance and conducting formal reviews of employee performance against agreed goals.
     </p>
     <p>
      The course explores the importance of recognising strong performance with positive feedback and how to give constructive feedback about areas for improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <em>
       Addressing Underperformance
      </em>
      part of the course provides employers with a step-by-step guide for dealing with situations in which employees are not performing duties to the required standard, displaying negative behaviour or failing to comply with workplace rules or procedures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Topics covered include approaching the initial performance discussion with the underperforming employee and formal steps for dealing with underperformance, including meetings and developing performance improvement plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says addressing underperformance, also known as performance management, can be challenging and confronting, but it is important.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is best to address underperformance issues promptly,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The longer that poor performance is allowed to continue, the more difficult it can be to resolve and the more serious the problem may become.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James believes it’s also important to address underperformance in the right way.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Good performance management practices can transform an underperforming employee into a strong performer. However, poorly handled performance management can increase the likelihood of legal disputes, such as unfair dismissal claims,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says dismissing a staff member because they’re not up to scratch and replacing them with another may actually cost an employer more than they realise.
     </p>
     <p>
      “First there’s the recruitment, induction and training, but add to that the costs associated with a new employee getting used to you, the business and the rest of the staff,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Realistically, it may be several months before a new starter’s confidence, productivity and efficiency levels match those of the under-performing employee whom they replaced! And there’s no guarantee you won’t end up back at square one.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Attempting to manage and work through under-performance issues is not always easy, but it makes good business sense to be pro-active.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Resolving small, isolated problems early can prevent significant workplace-wide problems developing later.”
     </p>
