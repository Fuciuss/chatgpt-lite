      <strong>
       30 April 2015
      </strong>

     <p>
      Thirty-two staff at a
      <strong>
       Cairns
      </strong>
      restaurant have shared in $24,300 back-pay after the Fair Work Ombudsman found the business was inadvertently short-changing its workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The restaurant’s chefs and waiting staff were underpaid their minimum hourly rates, overtime, weekend and late-night penalty rates over 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer was mistakenly paying the workers under an enterprise agreement that did not apply to the restaurant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman identified the problem during a random audit of the restaurant as part of a national campaign focussed on the hospitality sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the restaurant owners have co-operated with the Agency and voluntarily reimbursed all outstanding entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      “When we find mistakes, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the errors are not repeated,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the case highlights the importance of Cairns employers taking the time to ensure they understand their obligations to their employees under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A small mistake left over time can easily result in a hefty bill for back-payment of wages – so it is important employers get it right in the first place,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $7000 for a worker on
       <strong>
        Thursday Island
       </strong>
       who failed to receive her outstanding wages, annual leave entitlements, redundancy pay, unpaid travel expenses, training cost reimbursements and wages in lieu of notice when she was made redundant,
      </li>
      <li>
       $5800 for a young worker employed as a barista at a
       <strong>
        Cairns
       </strong>
       café underpaid the minimum hourly rate and weekend penalty rates over six months, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5400 for a
       <strong>
        Cairns
       </strong>
       accountant who had not received reimbursements she was entitled to for work expenses and was not paid her contractual bonus and annual leave entitlements on termination of employment.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website – and encouraged employers in the Tropical North to go to www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on
