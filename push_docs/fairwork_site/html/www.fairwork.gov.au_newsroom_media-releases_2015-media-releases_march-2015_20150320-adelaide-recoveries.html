      <strong>
       20 March 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      More than 100 Adelaide workers have been back-paid over $100,000 following recent inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven cleaners at a
      <strong>
       Salisbury
      </strong>
      business were reimbursed $32,000 – an average $4571 each – after being short-changed over a 12-month period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were paid flat hourly rates above the minimum, but not enough to cover penalty rates for overtime and shift work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman audited the business during a national campaign focused on the cleaning industry that recovered $763,000 for workers nationally, including $68,000 in South Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate case, 16 café staff at
      <strong>
       Glenelg
      </strong>
      were reimbursed a total of $18,400 after being underpaid their minimum hourly rates and weekend penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, the underpayments occurred because the employer was unaware of the minimum wage rates applicable to the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both employers co-operated with Fair Work inspectors and promptly reimbursed the employees all money owed, without the need for enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Unfortunately, we still see cases where employers pay flat hourly wage rates without considering whether overtime or penalty rates might apply,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important for employers to ensure they are fully aware of the wage rates applicable to their business, particular where overtime, weekend or evening shifts are involved.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries in and around Adelaide include:
     </p>

       $6100 for a

      </li>
      <li>
       $6000 for five employees at a

      </li>
      <li>
       $5700 for seven staff at a
       <strong>

       </strong>
       restaurant underpaid their minimum hourly rates and penalty rates for late-night and weekend work.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says the employees were reimbursed all money owed after Fair Work inspectors contacted the employers and explained their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We recognise that errors happen, so we have a flexible and fair approach when inadvertent mistakes occur and to employers who are willing to co-operate with us to ensure they don't occur in the future,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors also informed employers about the range of free tools available at www.fairwork.gov.au to help them comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online resources include tools to assist employers and employees determine the correct award and minimum wages for their industry, templates for time-and-wages records and an Online Learning Centre with free interactive courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses can sign up to a regular employer newsletter from the Fair Work Ombudsman with helpful workplace tips and information.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also has a particular focus on ensuring that the workplace rights of young workers and overseas workers are respected.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Young workers and overseas workers can be vulnerable if they aren’t aware of their workplace rights or are reluctant to complain, so we place a high priority on ensuring they receive their full entitlements,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any employee who believes their workplace rights have been compromised is encouraged to get in touch with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
