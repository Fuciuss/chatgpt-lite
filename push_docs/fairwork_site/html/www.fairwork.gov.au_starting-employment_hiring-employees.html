      Know the law
     </h2>
     <p>
      Before hiring a new employee, you need to make sure you know your rights and responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minimum terms and conditions of employment come from an award, registered agreement and contract of employment, and the
      <a href="/employee-entitlements/national-employment-standards">
       National Employment Standards
      </a>
      (NES). An employment contract or registered agreement can't provide for less than what is in the NES.
     </p>
     <p>
      To find the right award, use our
      <a href="/awards-and-agreements/awards/find-my-award/">
       Find my award tool
      </a>
      . To find out if an enterprise agreement applies, visit the

      To work out the right pay when hiring a new employee, you need to decide on the person’s employment status – whether they will be a full-time, part-time or casual employee. See our

     <p>
      It’s important to establish a good working relationship at the start of employment. There are a few things you can do to make sure this happens.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Getting your employment contracts right
     </h3>
     <p>
      It’s important that your employment contracts protect your business and your staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      To help you get things right, use the
      <a class="external-link" href="https://employ.business.gov.au/">
       business.gov.au – Employment Contract Tool
      </a>
      to create an employment contract that’s tailored to your business needs and complies with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      To use this tool, your employee must be:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       full-time, part-time or casual
      </li>
      <li>
       covered by an award
      </li>
      <li>
       paid an hourly or weekly wage.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Employment Contract Tool isn’t for every worker. It can’t be used for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employees who’ll be paid a salary
      </li>
      <li>
       apprentices and trainees
      </li>
      <li>
       seasonal workers
      </li>
      <li>
       independent contractors, or
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        employees covered by registered agreements.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Induction
     </h3>
     <p>
      Take the time to go through an induction with your new starter. Use this time to communicate your expectations and give them an opportunity to ask questions. It also helps employees feel informed, welcomed and prepared to do their job.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Productive workplaces
     </h3>
     <p>
      During the first few weeks of employment, employers and employees should organise a time to set goals and expectations. You can use this opportunity to outline training needs and create a plan together to ensure these needs are met.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Communication
     </h3>
     <p>
      Communication is an essential part of a good working relationship. Set up regular meetings to provide performance feedback and discuss any issues or concerns early, before they become workplace problems.
