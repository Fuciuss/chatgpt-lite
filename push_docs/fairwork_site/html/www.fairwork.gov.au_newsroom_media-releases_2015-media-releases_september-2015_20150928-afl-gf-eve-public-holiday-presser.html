      Victorian employers are being reminded that Friday will be a public holiday for the first time this year and they should check the pay rates and entitlements that apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that Victorian businesses operating on AFL Grand Final eve - Friday, October 2 - can get the information they need at www.fairwork.gov.au/publicholidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our website has all the information employers need to understand and comply with their rights and obligations with a minimum of stress," Ms James said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information available includes tools that employers can use to check the minimum public holiday penalty rates that apply to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says most underpayments on public holidays are inadvertent and are the result of employers not being fully aware of the rates that apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers who don’t take the time to check the minimum rates that apply on public holidays are at much greater risk of underpaying their employees,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Any underpayments have to be rectified, which means employers can end up facing bills for back-payment of wages they weren’t budgeting for.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Tools and resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au include templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The My Account tool allows users to save tailored information such as pay rates and conditions of employment specific to your circumstances.

      Small business can opt to be put through to a small business helpline, which has now assisted more than 250,000 callers since it was established.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure an even playing field for all businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are committed to supporting compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply,” she said.
