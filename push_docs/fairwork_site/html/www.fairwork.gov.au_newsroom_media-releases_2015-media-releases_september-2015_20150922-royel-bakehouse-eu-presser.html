      <strong>
       22 September 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Four workers at a café in
      <strong>
       Hobart
      </strong>
      have been back-paid almost $20,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three female and one male employee were being paid a flat rate of $14 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fast Food Industry Award 2010
      </em>
      they should have received an hourly rate of $23.15 and up to $27.79 on Saturdays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were short-changed a total of $19,256 between February, 2014 and March this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Individual underpayments ranged from $770 to $9674.
     </p>
     <p>
      The café, the Royel Bakehouse in the Centrepoint Shopping Centre, back-paid the workers all their outstanding entitlements after an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Royel Bakehouse owner Boon Seah told Fair Work inspectors he was unaware of minimum wage rates applicable to his workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      In an effort to encourage behavioural change, Mr Seah has been asked to sign an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) committing to future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EU requires Mr Seah to issue pay-slips (which he previously was not doing) and to engage an external accounting professional to audit the company’s compliance within 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Seah has expressed his “sincere regret” and apologised for his contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the case study is a timely reminder to businesses in Tasmania of the need to ensure they take the time to understand and comply with the laws applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This matter demonstrates how lack of awareness of minimum wages and conditions can lead to a hefty bill which can potentially have a negative financial impact on the business,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are committed to helping employers understand and comply with workplace laws, but operators also need to make an effort to get the basics right in the first place.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Small Business Helpline for advice on
      <strong>
       13 13 94.
      </strong>
      Overseas workers can call
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      if they need interpreter services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include pay rate calculators to help employers determine the correct Award and minimum wages for employees and free templates for pay slips and time-and-wages records.
