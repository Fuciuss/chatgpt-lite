      The Fair Work Ombudsman has received almost 1000 requests for assistance from workers claiming they have not been paid money promised to them for working for the No Land Tax Party at the last NSW state election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon hearing the allegations of non-compliance, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced an investigation and sought to engage with No Land Tax Party secretary Peter Jones to see if it could negotiate the back-payment of any outstanding wages and entitlements with him by agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is our standard practice in all alleged underpayment matters.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Mr Jones is not fully co-operating with the investigation and has been asked to meet with Fair Work inspectors to provide further information.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Jones has made misleading statements to his former workers regarding their eligibility for Fair Entitlements Guarantee assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman takes this matter very seriously.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman does not usually provide public commentary on its ongoing operational matters – however, given the above, and that up to 3600 people may be affected, it is important to reassure the public that the matter is receiving priority attention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s General Protections &amp; Misclassifications Team continues to gather evidence, including statements from affected workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is most concerned about the current allegations of non-compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency appreciates the information and strong support that has so far been provided by former workers to its inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information about Small Claims has also been provided, as some workers have expressed interest in taking their own action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will continue its investigations, including consideration of potential enforcement options against Mr Jones, and undertakes to keep affected workers informed of our work and the outcome.
