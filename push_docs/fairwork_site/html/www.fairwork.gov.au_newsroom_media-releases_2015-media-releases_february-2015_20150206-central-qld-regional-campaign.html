      The Fair Work Ombudsman will visit businesses in Central Queensland over the next few weeks to help raise awareness among employers of their obligations under federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will contact up to 225 businesses in
      <strong>
       Biloela
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Blackwater
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Emerald
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Gladstone
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Rockhampton
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Yeppoon
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the aim is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how her Agency can assist businesses to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important we check that workers are receiving their correct entitlements, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers in this region understand their obligations,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign will prioritise industries which generate the most requests for assistance from employees in Central Queensland – including road freight transport, accommodation, hairdressing, beauty services, security and cleaning.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will check that employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and are providing meal breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with record-keeping and pay slip obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says inspectors will work with employers in the region to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      They will also inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au  to assist them to understand and comply with their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and My Account, which enables employers and employees to save tailored information on pay and conditions for their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can also contact the Fair Work Ombudsman via the website or by calling the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      . An interpreter service is also available by calling
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Small business employers calling the Fair Work Infoline can opt to receive priority service via the Small Business Helpline.
