       13 June 2018 - Address to the Franchise Management Forum (Franchise Advisory Centre) - Reasonable Steps: the Regulator's Perspective
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On 13 June 2018 the former Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James delivered a speech to the Franchise Advisory Centre in Brisbane. Natalie used the address as an opportunity to release the FWO’s new guide for franchises:

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The guide, which was prepared in conjunction with the franchise community and FranchiseED, provides practical assistance for franchisors regarding the kinds of ‘reasonable steps’ required to build a culture of compliance in franchises in light of the Protecting Vulnerable Workers provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009. Natalie also reflected on the lessons learned from the FWO’s Caltex Inquiry report and the benefits that can flow when business enters into compliance partnerships with the FWO. Ultimately, Natalie called on those operating franchises to use the guide to proactively assess and mitigate the risks in their networks.

       7 February 2018 – Address to 2018 AIRAANZ Conference
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Former Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James considers the application of existing legal tests to new ways of working in the gig economy. Natalie provides insights into the relationship between vulnerable workers and the FWO’s compliance activities in areas which required new ways of thinking about regulation. The focus is on the positive changes effected in the trolley collection sector, 7-Eleven and Baiada as a result of our inquiries, compliance partnerships and enforceable undertakings. The address poses questions for academics and workplace practitioners about the way in which the law will keep pace with the evolution of work.

     <p>
      In her speech, former Chief Counsel Janine Webster, discusses how the Fair Work Ombudsman can build a better Australia for business by working together with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to achieve common interests. She explains why the Fair Work Ombudsman got involved in the 4 Yearly Modern Award Review process, our Supply Chain Strategy and how accessories such as managers, directors and others can now be liable for underpayment, not just employers. She invites the employer organisations to advise businesses about these and other developments and to work with them to ensure they avoid unnecessary risks.
