      Payment for time spent at training
     </h2>
     <p>
      Off-the-job training is time spent in structured training delivered by a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). It's often delivered at a site away from the workplace and referred to as trade school. It doesn't include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       normal work duties or
      </li>
      <li>
       supervised practice on the job.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Apprentices
     </h3>
     <p>
      The time you spend at trade school is paid time and is included in your ordinary hours of work (for example, 38 hours). You need to agree with your employer about how often you will go to trade school (for example, 1 day per week or week blocks of training). This is usually set out in your training plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you don't go to trade school when you're supposed to, you don't get paid for that time (unless you're on sick leave or another type of leave).
     </p>
     <h3>
      School-based apprentices
     </h3>
     <p>
      For school-based apprentices, the payment for trade school isn't worked out based on the actual hours you go to training. Instead, you get paid for 25% of the hours you work for your employer each week.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">

       Example: Payment for training for school-based apprentices
      </h3>
      <p>
       Sean is a full-time school student doing a school-based apprenticeship. He works 8 hours per week with his employer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sean is paid:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        for the 8 hours per week he works with his employer and
       </li>
       <li>
        2 hours per week for his off-the-job training (25% of 8 hours).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In total, Sean needs to be paid 10 hours per week.

       can be averaged over a semester or the year.

      Training costs – fees and textbooks
     </h2>
     <p>
      Many awards have entitlements for training costs, fees and textbooks.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should be reimbursed for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       all the fees charged by your RTO that are related to your training
      </li>
      <li>
       the cost of your prescribed textbooks for your apprenticeship.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <a href="#award-entitlements">
       Check your award

     </p>
     <h3>
      When training costs aren't reimbursed
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employer doesn't have to reimburse you for fees and textbooks if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       your progress in the course is unsatisfactory
      </li>
      <li>
       your employer pays the costs and fees directly to the training organisation, or
      </li>
      <li>
       you aren't working for them at the set time that the costs have to be reimbursed.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the Government reimburses you for any part of the training, the employer doesn’t have to reimburse you for those expenses.
