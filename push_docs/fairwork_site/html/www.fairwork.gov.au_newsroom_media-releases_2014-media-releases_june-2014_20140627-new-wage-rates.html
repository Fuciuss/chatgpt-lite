      New minimum wage rates apply from next Tuesday, July 1 – and the Fair Work Ombudsman is encouraging employers to check pay guides on its website ahead of time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The transition to modern award rates of pay also ends on July 1 which will make accessing information on wages and conditions much simpler.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 2010, wages in awards have been gradually phasing from multiple state-based rates to one national rate. People have had to identify ‘old’ and ‘new’ award classifications and perform calculations to determine the correct rates. These time-consuming processes will no longer be necessary under the majority of awards from July 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We now have a truly national system of modern awards. What this means is that calculating wages is about to become a whole lot simpler,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This makes it easier for employees to work out what they should be earning. Employers, too, can access the Fair Work Ombudsman’s simple online pay tools to work out the correct pay rates for their staff.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman relaunched its website this month, and employers can now check the pay guides that apply to their industry and create their own account where they can save information relevant to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Federal Employment Minister, the Hon Senator Eric Abetz, welcomed the initiative, saying he was pleased the Fair Work Ombudsman was focussing on getting reliable and credible information to small businesses people in a convenient, accessible way.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I encourage small business people to visit
      <a href="/">
       www.fairwork.gov.au
      </a>
      and use the tools and resources that have been designed to assist them meet their obligations as easily as possible,” Senator Abetz said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website also assists users with basic information, such as wages, and provides tools and resources for employers who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website has an interactive Online Learning Centre, which has already attracted more than 10,000 users, with courses on topics such as
      <em>
       Difficult conversations in the workplace
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Hiring new employees.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Agency is always looking for new and innovative ways to help employers understand and meet their obligations and acquire the knowledge they need to run their business in a productive way.
