      Minimum notice periods for employees over 45 years old

     <p>
      An employee has to get an extra week of notice if they’re over 45 years old and have worked for the employer for at least 2 years.

      Ending the notice period early
     </h3>
     <p>
      If an employee has been dismissed and wants to leave during the notice period, the employer can agree to reduce the employee's notice period.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employer doesn't agree to reduce the notice period, the employee can choose to resign and give their own minimum notice. Any time the employee has already worked during the original notice period doesn't count.
     </p>

     <h3>
      Continuous service
     </h3>
     <p>
      The minimum notice period an employer has to give is based on the employee's continuous service with them. Continuous service is the length of time they are employed by the business. Service includes authorised unpaid leave (for example, unpaid parental leave). Service will not include any periods of unauthorised leave or absences.

       Example: Counting unpaid parental leave periods when ending employment
      </h3>
      <p>
       Joan has been employed for 5 years and 3 months. This includes a 12 month period of unpaid parental leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joan's manager needs to terminate her employment due to her position being made redundant and is trying to work out how much notice of termination to give.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joan's award refers to the National Employment Standards for notice of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joan's continuous service for the purpose of notice would include the time while she was on 12 months unpaid parental leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joan will be entitled to 4 weeks notice of termination given by her employer.

      If an employer gives more notice than needed
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employer provides more notice than required in the award, registered agreement or contract, the employee only has to work out the minimum notice period. They can work out the extra notice if they want to. If the employee only works the minimum notice period, the employer doesn't have to pay the extra notice period.

      Taking leave during a notice period
     </h2>
     <p>
      An employee can take annual leave during a notice period if the employer agrees to the leave. An employer can't force an employee to take leave as part of the notice period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice can include public holidays. They don't extend the notice period.

     <p>
      An employee can take sick leave during a notice period if they give:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       notice of the leave as soon as possible
      </li>
      <li>
       evidence if the employer asks for it (for example, medical certificate).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      No paid sick leave left
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employee who has used up all their sick leave may take unpaid sick leave. They have to give the employer notice and evidence.
