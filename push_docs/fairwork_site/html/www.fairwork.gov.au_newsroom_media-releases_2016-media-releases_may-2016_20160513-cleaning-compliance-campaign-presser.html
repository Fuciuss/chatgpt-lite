     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has again called on cleaning contractors to pay greater attention to wage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another of the Agency’s national campaigns has once more found cleaning businesses continuing to short-change their workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors have recovered another $17,000 for 59 cleaners following auditing of 54 employers nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      The businesses were assessed to monitor compliance with minimum wage rates, penalty rates, allowances, overtime, pay-slip and record-keeping obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The audits revealed that 33 per cent of cleaning businesses were paying their workers incorrectly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of concern was the finding that 18 businesses which had previously been found to be non-compliant were underpaying staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says all 18 were issued with formal Letters of Caution about their behaviour and two companies received on-the-spot fines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says they all are now on notice that continuing breaches of workplace law may result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last financial year, the Fair Work Ombudsman received more than 7600 calls from cleaners concerned about their wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency also dealt with 500 requests for assistance from cleaners, recording an overall contravention rate of 40 per cent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Previous campaigns have identified similar levels of non-compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2010-11, a national campaign found 37 per cent of 366 cleaning businesses audited had workplace breaches, and a total of $242,451 in underpaid wages and entitlements was recouped for 621 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      A follow-up campaign in 2012-13 showed an overall contravention rate of 38 per cent of 578 businesses audited and another $762,766 being recovered for 1212 underpaid employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James acknowledged that competitive tendering and tight profit margins may have compromised the ability of some cleaning businesses to meet their compliance obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, she warned that employers could not look to cut costs by under-cutting and ignoring minimum wage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      All cleaning businesses found to be non-compliant will be re-audited again as part of a National Compliance Monitoring Campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says if further contraventions of workplace laws are identified, enforcement measures, including legal action, will be considered.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the last Census, almost two-third of cleaners are female and almost 40 per cent of employees were born overseas. Many are international students.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the cleaning workforce is therefore considered to be a vulnerable cohort and open to exploitation by unscrupulous operators.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says the Fair Work Ombudsman has been working with key industry participants as part of a Cleaning Accountability Framework to promote a culture of compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
