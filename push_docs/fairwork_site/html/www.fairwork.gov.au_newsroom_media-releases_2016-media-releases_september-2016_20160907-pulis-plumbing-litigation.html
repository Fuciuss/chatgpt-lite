     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against a Victorian plumbing business, alleging a young employee was short-changed more than $26,000 over a period of just three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing the Federal Circuit Court is Melbourne man Michael Patrick Pulis and his business Pulis Plumbing Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      A 20-year-old plumber’s labourer was allegedly underpaid a total of $26,882 for work performed in the
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Geelong
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Bendigo
      </strong>
      areas between September 12 and December 15, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Pulis allegedly paid the employee apprentice rates of $12.18 an hour for a 40-hour week, despite never signing the employee up to an apprenticeship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the applicable Enterprise Agreement, the employee should have been paid rates of $37.08 for ordinary hours and up to $74.16 for overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leave and termination entitlements and meal and travel allowances were allegedly also underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman says it has previously advised Mr Pulis that only registered apprentices could be paid apprentice rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following a prior complaint to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the company agreed to back-pay an employee $300.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Pulis and his company allegedly also breached record-keeping and pay-slip laws and failed to comply with a Notice to Produce records issued by a Fair Work inspector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action has been commenced because of Mr Pulis’ refusal to co-operate and rectify the alleged underpayment and because he had previously been put on notice of the need to comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We treat underpayment of young workers particularly seriously and we are concerned about the treatment of vulnerable young people seeking to become qualified in a trade,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Mr Pulis and his company committed multiple contraventions of workplace laws. Pulis Plumbing Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention, while Mr Pulis faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order requiring Mr Pulis and the company to back-pay the employee in full, plus superannuation and interest. A directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on October 31.
