       A retail worker at
       <strong>
        Colac
       </strong>
       in Victoria’s south-west region has been back-paid $13,800 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The part-time employee was paid just $11 an hour over a 12-month period.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He should have received a minimum hourly rate of $20.13 under the
       <em>
        General Retail Industry Award
       </em>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the worker’s employer avoided enforcement action by promptly rectifying the underpayment after being issued with a Compliance Notice.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We’ve put this business on notice that it is unlawful to undercut minimum lawful pay rates, even if an employee says they agree to it,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Other recent recoveries in Victoria’s south-west include:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        $14,835 for seven employees at a
        <strong>
         Warrnambool
        </strong>
        services business who were underpaid minimum lawful wage rates as a result of the employer not updating pay rates following an Annual Wage Review decision, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $7580 for three
        <strong>
         Warrnambool
        </strong>
        manufacturing workers who were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and overtime.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       All underpayments were discovered during proactive Fair Work Ombudsman audits.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says most underpayments identified by the Agency are inadvertent and the result of employers failing to check their minimum obligations under workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “However, we will take enforcement action against employers with significant non-compliance issues where we believe it is in the public interest to do so.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It is important that businesses, particularly small businesses, know that they can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for advice if they are unsure about their obligations.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman recovered a total of $185,000 for 156 underpaid employees throughout South-west Victoria last financial year.
