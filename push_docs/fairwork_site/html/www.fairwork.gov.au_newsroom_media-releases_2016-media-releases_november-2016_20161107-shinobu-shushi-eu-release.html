      <strong>
       7 November 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A sushi restaurant chain has narrowly avoided legal action for producing false pay records by agreeing to overhaul practices across its outlets and donate $10,000 to a community organisation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shinobu Sushi Bar Pty Ltd provided inspectors from the Fair Work Ombudsman with false records during an audit of its outlet at Park Beach Plaza in
      <strong>
       Coffs Harbour
      </strong>
      , NSW.
     </p>
     <p>
      The audit was part of an ongoing Fair Work Ombudsman compliance activity that involves visits by Fair Work inspectors to more than 40 sushi outlets across
      <strong>
       Northern NSW
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Newcastle
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Central Coast NSW
      </strong>
      , the
      <strong>
       Gold Coast
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Canberra
      </strong>
      , to check workers are being correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      After inspectors challenged Shinobu Sushi Bar over the authenticity of the records, the company admitted it did not keep any records and that the records it provided were false.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lack of records prevented inspectors from assessing whether staff at the Coffs Harbour outlet, including overseas workers on student and 417 working holiday visas, were being paid correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shinobu Sushi Bar also has an outlet in
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      and an outlet at
      <strong>
       Rockhampton
      </strong>
      , in Queensland.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company and its operator, Xiaoqiang “Johnny” Lin have agreed to enter into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman, as an alternative to litigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the terms of the EU, Shinobu Sushi Bar has made one $5000 donation to the Queensland Working Women’s Centre and will make another $5000 donation to the organisation next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company will also undertake measures aimed at improving compliance, including engaging an independent specialist to audit practices across its stores in each of the next two years; upgrading its systems and processes to ensure future compliance; registering with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s My Account portal; and commissioning workplace relations training for managers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company must also apologise to the workers and display notices in its workplaces that detail its contraventions and provide information about minimum lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the company narrowly avoided legal action by admitting its contraventions when challenged and agreeing to a range of remedial outcomes, which could not have been achieved through litigation in Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says business operators need to be aware that deliberate contraventions of record-keeping laws are being treated particularly seriously. In the 2015-16 financial year, 16 of the 50 legal actions (32 per cent) commenced by the Fair Work Ombudsman involved allegations of knowingly false or misleading records.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I welcome the Government’s commitments to enhance workplace laws to better protect vulnerable workers, including increasing applicable penalties for serious record-keeping breaches,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said she was also concerned about the number of instances of non-compliance matters among culturally and linguistically diverse business owners who employ overseas workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I want to make it clear that all employers in Australia must comply with workplace laws," she said.
