      The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is reminding employers that the national minimum wage has today increased to $19.49 per hour (up from $18.93), or $740.80 per week (up from $719.20).
     </p>
     <p>
      On 30 May 2019, the Fair Work Commission (FWC) announced a three per cent increase to the national minimum wage, following its
      <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-agreements/minimum-wages-conditions/annual-wage-reviews/annual-wage-review-2018-19/decisions">
       Annual Wage Review

      . This increase applies from the first full pay period starting on or after 1 July 2019.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also reminding businesses that further changes to certain penalty rates in the Hospitality, Pharmacy, Fast Food and Retail industries come into effect today, following determination from the FWC.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said that workplace compliance issues are often traced back to employers failing to update rates of pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Fair Work Ombudsman has a range of free tools available to help employers comply with their workplace obligations, which have been updated to reflect the new pay rates.  We urge all businesses to visit our
      <a href="https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/">
       Pay and Conditions Tool
      </a>
      to check the lawful minimum rates that they need to pay their staff, or to contact us directly for assistance,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      For employees covered by an award, base rates will also increase by three per cent today.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We encourage workers who receive award wages, such as juniors, apprentices and trainees, to visit our
      <a href="https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/">
       Pay and Conditions Tool
      </a>
      and familiarise yourself with your new rates of pay. If you are unsure which award applies to you, you can use our
      <a href="/awards-and-agreements/awards/find-my-award/">
       Find my award
      </a>
      tool. Any workers with concerns about their pay should contact the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO has industry specific tools such as interactive graphics for the
      <a href="/find-help-for/fast-food-restaurants-cafes/fast-food-industry">
       Fast Food Award
      </a>

      </a>
      , which provide tailored information about pay rates and conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO also has further information available on the Penalty rates changes, including who they affect and how they are being implemented.
