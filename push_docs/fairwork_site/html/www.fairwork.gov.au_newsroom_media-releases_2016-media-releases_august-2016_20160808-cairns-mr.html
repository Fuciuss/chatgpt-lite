     </p>
     <p>
      A
      <strong>
       Cairns
      </strong>
      tourism employee owed wages for working up to 109 hours a fortnight has been reimbursed thousands of dollars following action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Japanese worker, who specialised in the overseas tourism market, was paid sporadically for months, then not at all for her final five pay periods before she resigned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The visa-holder sought assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman after the employer failed to rectify the matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors subsequently determined that by the time she resigned, the worker was owed more than $10,100 in unpaid wages, annual leave and leave loadings.
     </p>
     <p>
      A co-worker, who was also a visa-holder, resigned after a week because she was not paid for two days training and three days work. She was back-paid more than $960.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer told Fair Work inspectors the underpayments occurred because the business could not afford to pay wages on a regular basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      “For an employer to simply shrug off their legal responsibilities to staff by saying they can’t afford to pay them is simply not acceptable,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      In separate matters, the Fair Work Ombudsman also recouped:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $22,400 for 11 security workers in
       <strong>
        Cairns
       </strong>
       who were underpaid for seven months because their employer failed to pass on the annual wage increase,
      </li>
      <li>
       $9800 for a
       <strong>
        Clifton Beach
       </strong>
       fast-food worker who received $12 an hour for 11 months when she should have been paid a minimum of $18.98 and up to $29.66 at weekends, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $6800 for three
       <strong>
        Cairns
       </strong>
       tradesmen who, over seven months, received overtime after 40 hours work a week instead of 38 hours.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is important for anyone running a business to understand the workplace laws applicable to their business.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers in Cairns need to be aware that there are minimum wage rates, they apply to all workers, and they are not negotiable,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is the responsibility of employers to be fully aware of the wage rates and entitlements that they are obliged to pay their workers.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the businesses avoided enforcement action because they co-operated, agreed to repay all monies owed and pledged ongoing compliance with their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
