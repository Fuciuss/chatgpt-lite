       The Fair Work Ombudsman today urged employers and employees to check the pay rates and entitlements that apply over the upcoming Easter public holidays.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Whether you are a business operator preparing for Easter trading or an employee working through Easter, it's important you are aware of the public holidays and any penalty rates that apply,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said today.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We’ve updated our website to help employers and workers understand and comply with their rights and obligations with a minimum of stress this Easter.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Information available at
      </span>
      www.fairwork.gov.au/publicholidays
      <span>
       includes an overview of the workplace laws that apply on public holidays, including what employers need to pay and what employees are entitled to.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       There are tools that employers can use to check the minimum pay rates and entitlements specific to their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The website also contains details of applicable public holidays in each state and territory.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Good Friday (April 3) and Easter Monday (April 6) are national public holidays, with some states and territories also declaring Easter Saturday and/or Easter Sunday public holidays.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers and workers seeking advice and assistance can also call the Fair Work Infoline on

       .
      </span>

      <span>
       Small business employers calling the Fair Work Infoline can opt to receive priority service via the Small Business Helpline.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says most underpayments are inadvertent and are the result of employers failing to check their obligations under workplace laws, so it’s important employers take the time to get it right this Easter.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It is important for employers to be fully aware of the minimum pay rates that apply to their employees, otherwise they can end up facing bills for back-payment of wages they weren’t budgeting for,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure an even playing field for all businesses.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We are committed to supporting compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply,” she said.
