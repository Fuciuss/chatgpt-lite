      A NSW security contractor will face Court for allegedly underpaying 14 employees at
      <strong>
       Coffs Harbour
      </strong>
      almost $94,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FairWork Ombudsman has commenced legal action against the Northcoast Security Services Group Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney is
      <strong>
       Woolgoolga
      </strong>
      man Kuldeep Chouhan, a former director and part-owner of the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Northcoast Security Services allegedly underpaid the guards a total of $93,779 for work performed in 2012 and 2013 in and around Coffs Harbour.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged the underpayments are largely the result of staff being paid flat rates as low as $18 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, under the Security Services Award, they were entitled to around $40 an hour for some weekend, public holiday, night and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also allegedly breached record-keeping laws, underpaid broken shift allowances and made unlawful deductions from employee wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two guards were allegedly underpaid $29,650 and $23,731 respectively. Other alleged underpayments range from $294 to $8420.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the guards contacted the Agency for help.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action was initiated after a lack of co-operation from Mr Chouhan and the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Northcoast had previously come to the Agency’s attention and Mr Chouhan had been warned in the past about the need to pay employees their full lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      A former employee was back-paid $600.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the latest matter, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges multiple contraventions of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Chouhan faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Northcoast Security Services faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for full back-payment. Less than $2000 of the money allegedly owed has been reimbursed to date.
