      The Fair Work Ombudsman today reminded employers about an increase in the minimum wage from Wednesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      After July 1, the new national minimum wage for a full-time adult will be $17.29 an hour, or $656.90 a week.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is encouraging employers to use its online pay tools to check new pay rates applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      These can be accessed at

      </a>
      .
     </p>

      “In our experience, a common cause of underpayment of wages is the failure by employers to pass on annual wage increases,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our Online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Modern Award, as well as classification and pay rates, including base pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman provides practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply in support of encouraging compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and assisting them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the overwhelming majority of employers want to do the right thing by their employees and get it right when it comes to workplace laws.
