      What is a Fair Work Commission order?
     </h2>
     <p>
      An order is a direction given by a Member of the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) in accordance with a decision. In relation to unfair dismissal applications, an order may:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       dismiss an unfair dismissal application
      </li>
      <li>
       require compensation to be paid
      </li>
      <li>
       require reinstatement, or
      </li>
      <li>
       require compensation to be paid and reinstatement.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An order made by the Commission is legally binding. However the Commission does not have the power to enforce an order. The enforcement of orders is further explained in this fact sheet.
     </p>
     <h2>
      <a id="terms-of-settlement" name="terms-of-settlement">
      </a>
      Is an order the same as a Terms of Settlement document?
     </h2>
     <p>
      An order is different from a Terms of Settlement document. A Terms of Settlement is a document signed by two parties agreeing to a settlement, and is usually obtained during the conciliation process of an unfair dismissal application with the Commission. This fact sheet does not cover Terms of Settlement documents. For information on enforcing a Terms of Settlement document legal advice may need to be sought. Please see the Further information section below.
     </p>
     <h2>
      <a id="options-available" name="options-available">
      </a>
      What options are available when non-compliance of an order occurs?
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employee does not receive compensation ordered by the Commission, there are several options to seek enforcement through the commencement of civil proceedings in:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the Federal Circuit Court of Australia or a State Magistrates Court by commencing a small claim proceeding
      </li>
      <li>
       the Fair Work Division of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, or
      </li>
      <li>
       an eligible State or Territory Court such as a District or County Court or state industrial relations commission.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Normally an order for compensation from the Commission will provide a timeframe within which compensation is to be paid. It is advisable to wait until the timeframe has lapsed before seeking a non-compliance option.
     </p>

      What is a small claim proceeding?
     </h2>
     <p>
      A small claim proceeding in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia or a State Magistrates Court is a way by which a person can seek to recover unpaid monies. The proceedings are generally more informal than other court proceedings and each party can only be represented by a lawyer if permission is given by the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can recover up to $100,000 through the small claim procedure. In some cases, the court may allow the successful applicant to recover any court filing fees paid from the respondent. A pecuniary penalty order cannot be sought through this procedure. If an unfair dismissal order for compensation is more than this, you can still make a claim for enforcement of the order using other court procedures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further information regarding small claims procedures can be found at section 548 of the Fair Work Act (FW Act).

      Penalties
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employer has not complied with an unfair dismissal order made by the Commission, it is possible for courts, such as the Federal Court of Australia, Federal Circuit Court of Australia, or an eligible State or Territory court to order the payment of an additional penalty. This kind of penalty is known as a pecuniary penalty and is in addition to any order made by the Commission.
     </p>

      Fair Work Ombudsman

     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is an independent statutory agency, separate from the Fair Work Commission.

The Fair Work Ombudsman is also responsible for impartially enforcing compliance with the FW Act and fair work instruments.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an unfair dismissal order made by the Commission is not complied with, you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for information on possible assistance with enforcing the order.
