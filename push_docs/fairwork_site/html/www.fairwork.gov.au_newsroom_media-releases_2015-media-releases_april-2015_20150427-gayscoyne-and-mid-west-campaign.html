      <strong>

     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is randomly auditing up to 125 businesses across the Gascoyne and Mid-West regions of Western Australia as part of a new campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors are checking that employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and are providing meal breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with record-keeping and pay slip obligations is also being monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign is focused on businesses from a range of sectors, including agriculture, horticulture, rock lobster farming, hospitality, accommodation and security industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major centres that have been earmarked for attention are
      <strong>
       Carnarvon
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Exmouth
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Geraldton
      </strong>
      .
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the aim is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says inspectors will work with employers to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      They will also inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, an Online learning centre and My Account, which enables employers and employees to save information on pay and conditions for their workplace.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit the website or call the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>

      </strong>
      . An interpreter service is also available by calling
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Small business employers calling the Fair Work Infoline can opt to receive priority service via the Small Business Helpline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last financial year the Fair Work Ombudsman’s campaigns team pro-actively audited 4567 employers throughout Australia, resulting in more than $4 million in unpaid wages and entitlements being recouped for 7541 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      This financial year, the Fair Work Ombudsman is conducting four national campaigns and two campaigns in each State and Territory.
