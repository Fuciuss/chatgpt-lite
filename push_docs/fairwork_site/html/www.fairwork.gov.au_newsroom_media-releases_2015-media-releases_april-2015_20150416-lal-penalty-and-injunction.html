      <strong>
       16 April 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has imposed an unprecedented injunction restraining a
      <strong>
       NSW
      </strong>
      hairdresser from underpaying any staff he employs in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has also imposed penalties totalling $162,000, following legal action initiated by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nelvin Nitesh Lal, who formerly ran hairdressing salons in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      and on the Central and South Coast of NSW, has been fined $20,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, penalties amounting to $142,000 have been imposed against Lal’s businesses, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $80,000 against
       <strong>
        NSW Central Coast
       </strong>
       business Hair Industrie Erina Pty Ltd,
      </li>
      <li>
       $40,000 against
       <strong>
        Sydney
       </strong>
       business House of Colour @ Hurstville Pty Ltd, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $22,000 against
       <strong>
        NSW South Coast
       </strong>
       business The House of Colour @ Shellharbour Pty Ltd.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Following unprecedented action by the Fair Work Ombudsman, the Court has also issued an Order restraining Lal from underpaying any hairdressing employees he recruits in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lal could potentially face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayments proven in Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the injunction was sought in response to the Agency’s concern about a pattern of non-compliant behaviour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency has received a number of requests for assistance from young, vulnerable workers at Lal’s salons.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Young workers can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or are reluctant to seek help, so we place a high priority on taking action to ensure their rights are protected,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court found that four employees had been underpaid a total of more than $6000, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       An employee aged in her early 20s at Hair Industrie Erina, underpaid $4189 as a result of being paid a flat weekly rate regardless of the hours she worked, which resulted in underpayment of her minimum wages and weekend and overtime penalty rates,
      </li>
      <li>
       An employee at House of Colour @ Hurstville paid nothing for seven days of work, but entitled to receive $1224 in wages and entitlements, and
      </li>
      <li>
       Two employees at Shellharbour underpaid a total of $765, including a 19-year-old employee unlawfully being paid nothing for two full days of work performed on a trial basis and an employee in her early 20s paid only $250 for five full days of work.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The underpayments occurred at various periods of time between June, 2012 and September, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace laws relating to issuing of payslips and responding to a Compliance Notice were also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has ordered Lal’s companies to rectify the underpayments of the workers, who have not received any back-pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says Fair Work inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with Lal before placing the matter before the Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Unfortunately, we were not able to secure sufficient co-operation, which is not acceptable,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our preference is to seek to work with employers to resolve issues co-operatively, but we will consider enforcement action when employers refuse to engage with inspectors.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a range of free tools available at www.fairwork.gov.au to help employers comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to assist employers and employees determine the correct award and minimum wages for their industry, templates for time-and-wages records and an Online Learning Centre with free interactive courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are also Best Practice Guides on a range of topics, including an employer’s guide to employing young workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
