      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against a
      <strong>
       Ballarat
      </strong>
      cleaning business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Kerryn Ainley, who trades as the Cleaning Fairy, faces court for allegedly failing to comply with a Compliance Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector commenced an investigation into the business after the regulator received requests for assistance from four cleaners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice was issued in November 2019 after the inspector formed a belief that employees had not received the casual loading provided by the
      <em>
       Cleaning Services Award 2010.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice required the business to check whether casual staff had been paid correctly and make up any shortfall in pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulator alleges that Mr Ainley did not take any action in response to the Compliance Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker says Compliance Notices are an important tool to recover unpaid wages for workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, inspectors can issue a Compliance Notice if they form a belief that an employer has breached certain workplace laws. Where employers do not comply with our notices, a court can order them to pay penalties in addition to back-paying any affected employees.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “We will continue to utilise our full suite of enforcement tools to hold employers to account and any workers with concerns should contact us,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a sole trader, Ms Ainley faces a penalty of up to $6,300 for failing to take any action in response to the Compliance Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a Court Order requiring Ms Ainley to comply with the notice, which includes rectifying the underpayments in full, plus superannuation and interest.
