      The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) has recovered wages for 99 underpaid
      <strong>

      </strong>
      workers in a
      <a href="/about-us/news-and-media-releases/2017-media-releases/june-2017/20170620-fwo-asic-joint-campaign">
       joint campaign
      </a>
      with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors and ASIC analysts visited 48 small to medium-sized businesses in and around Melbourne’s CBD – including the suburbs of
      <strong>
       Balwyn
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Carlton
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       North Melbourne
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Port Melbourne
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO and ASIC targeted businesses that were run by first-time directors operating across a range of sectors, such as accommodation and food services, construction, and rental, hiring and real estate services. These businesses had not previously been audited by the FWO.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found that 26 businesses were fully compliant with their lawful obligations under the Fair Work Act. Of the remaining 22 businesses visited, six had pay slip and record-keeping contraventions, nine had monetary contraventions, and seven had both pay slip and record-keeping and monetary contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest underpayment occurred at a CBD noodle bar that short-changed 14 employees a total of $8,694, as a result of underpaying minimum hourly rates and penalty rates over a six-month period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors issued two formal cautions. There were also eight Infringement Notices totalling $7,020 in fines issued for pay slip and record-keeping breaches. A Compliance Notice was issued for a restaurant, requiring the employer to back-pay $5,303 to 14 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      All businesses agreed to back-pay employees in-full after being educated by inspectors. In total, 99 employees were back-paid $39,362 by 14 businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said ignorance is no excuse for underpaying employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “During our surprise visits of several Melbourne workplaces, we were alarmed to discover that many first-time company directors were not aware of their lawful obligations under Australia’s workplace relations laws,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “If you are new to running a business, it is your responsibility to ensure you understand your workplace obligations before you hire any employees. The Fair Work Ombudsman has a range of free
      <a href="/small-business-showcase">
       tools and resources
      </a>
      available to help directors get the basics right as quickly as possible. Any directors with concerns should contact us before we visit their business,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      All non-compliant businesses were put on notice that they may be re-audited in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      ASIC analysts spoke with the first-time company directors about their responsibilities under the Corporations Act and provided a range of education resources.
