      Who are Fair Work Inspectors?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors are government officials appointed by the Fair Work Ombudsman under the Fair Work Act (FW Act). The FW Act gives Fair Work Inspectors certain powers to perform their role to promote and monitor compliance with relevant Commonwealth workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector’s role includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       investigating suspected contraventions of relevant Commonwealth workplace laws and fair work instruments (for example, an award or industrial agreement)
      </li>
      <li>
       conducting compliance audits
      </li>
      <li>
       investigating workplace complaints
      </li>
      <li>
       taking steps to enforce relevant Commonwealth workplace laws and fair work instruments through the court system (where necessary)
      </li>
      <li>
       conducting targeted education campaigns in industries and regions.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      All Fair Work Inspectors are issued with an identity card that they must carry with them at all times when performing functions or exercising their powers. You can ask to see a Fair Work Inspector’s identity card to confirm their identity.
     </p>
     <h2>
      <a id="what-are-their-powers" name="what-are-their-powers">
      </a>
      What are their powers?
     </h2>
     <h3>
      Powers to enter premises
     </h3>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector may enter certain premises for compliance purposes if they reasonably believe either:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the FW Act, or a fair work instrument applies to the workplace, or
      </li>
      <li>
       records or documents relevant to compliance are on business premises (including documents on a computer).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Before entering premises, a Fair Work Inspector must show their identity card to the occupier of the premises or their representative. If this isn’t possible, the Fair Work Inspector must show their identity card as soon as practicable after entering.
     </p>
     <p>
      In entering premises, a Fair Work Inspector must not use force, but does not need permission from the occupier. However, they must not enter a part of a premises that is used for residential purposes unless they reasonably believe that work is being performed on that part of the premises.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector may enter premises at any time during working hours, or at any other time they believe is necessary for compliance purposes.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Powers while on the premises
     </h3>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector may exercise one or more of the following powers while on the premises:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       inspect any work, process or object
      </li>
      <li>
       interview anyone (with their consent)
      </li>
      <li>
       require a person to tell them who has or who can access a record or document
      </li>
      <li>
       require the person with access to a record or document to hand it over while the inspector is on the premises or within a specific time frame
      </li>
      <li>
       inspect and make copies of any record or document kept on the premises (including in hardcopy or accessible from a computer)
      </li>
      <li>
       take samples of any goods or substances after informing the owner or other relevant person in charge of the goods or substances.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      To assist an investigation, a suitably qualified and experienced person may accompany a Fair Work Inspector onto the premises. For example, assistants may include information technology specialists, forensic accountants or interpreters. Such assistants can attend the premises with a Fair Work Inspector only if the Fair Work Ombudsman is satisfied that the assistance is necessary and reasonable.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Intentionally hindering or obstructing a Fair Work Inspector
     </h3>
     <p>
      The FW Act prohibits a person from intentionally hindering or obstructing a Fair Work Inspector (or a person assisting a Fair Work Inspector on premises) in the course of performing functions or exercising powers. This includes denying entry to a premise or intentionally withholding documents.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person will not contravene this obligation if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       there was a reasonable excuse for the hindrance or obstruction, or
      </li>
      <li>
       if the inspector is required to show their identity card, either the inspector:
       <ul>
        <li>
         didn’t show their identity card, or
        </li>
        <li>
         didn’t tell the person they may be contravening the FW Act if they intentionally hinder or obstruct the inspector in performing their functions or exercising their powers.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Powers to ask for a person’s name and address
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a Fair Work Inspector reasonably believes that a person has contravened the FW Act, or a fair work instrument, and the contravention may attract a monetary penalty, the Fair Work Inspector can require that person to tell them their name and address.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Inspector may also require a person to provide evidence (for example, a driver’s licence) that the name and address they provided is correct.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Inspector must show their identity card and tell the person that they may be liable to a civil penalty should they not comply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The person must comply with the requirement to provide evidence of their name and address unless they have a reasonable excuse (for example, if they are asked to provide evidence and they do not have a form of identification available).
     </p>
     <h3>
      Powers to require a person to produce records or documents
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the course of an investigation, a Fair Work Inspector can issue a written Notice to Produce Records or Documents, requiring a person to provide records or documents at a particular location, within a specified time period of at least 14 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is a contravention of the FW Act if a person fails to comply with a written Notice to Produce Records or Documents and has no reasonable excuse. A person cannot refuse to comply with a Notice to Produce Records or Documents on the grounds that providing the requested records or documents may incriminate them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a person has failed to comply with a written Notice to Produce Records or Documents, the Fair Work Inspector may recommend litigation against the person for civil penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector can keep any records or documents they are provided for any period that is considered necessary. A Fair Work Inspector must make the records or documents available at all reasonable times to the person who produced them (or another person they authorise), or anyone else entitled to their possession, for inspection or to copy.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Providing false or misleading information or documents
     </h3>
     <p>
      The FW Act prohibits a person from knowingly or recklessly providing false or misleading information or documents to a Fair Work Inspector exercising powers or performing functions under a Commonwealth law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Inspector must take reasonable steps to tell the person that they may be liable to a civil remedy for providing false or misleading information or documents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Knowingly providing false or misleading information or documents to a Commonwealth official may also be a criminal offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Powers to issue compliance notices
     </h3>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector can issue a compliance notice where they hold a reasonable belief that a person has contravened certain provisions of the FW Act or certain fair work instruments (for example, modern awards, enterprise agreements or the national minimum wage order).
     </p>
     <p>
      A compliance notice will include information about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how the person has breached a workplace law
      </li>
      <li>
       what the person needs to do to fix the issue (for example, pay an amount to 1 or more employees and/or give evidence to show the issue has been fixed)
      </li>
      <li>
       the time the person has to fix the issue (for example, that payment is made within 28 days)
      </li>
      <li>
       how the person can apply to have the notice reviewed by a court
      </li>
      <li>
       what happens if a person doesn’t comply with the notice.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman cannot initiate legal proceedings for breaches set out in the compliance notice if the person complies with it.
