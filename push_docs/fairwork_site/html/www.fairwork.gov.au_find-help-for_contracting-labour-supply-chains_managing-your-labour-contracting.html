     <p>
      When you are looking to contract out labour, it’s a good idea to make sure you understand the cost of employment. Your contractor/subcontractor will need to pay their employees correctly as well as cover employment costs (like superannuation, workers' compensation, payroll tax, insurance and licenses). If you understand these costs, it'll help you make sure the contracted price isn't too low.

      Some states have laws requiring labour hire businesses to be licensed, and for users of labour hire to only use licensed labour hire providers. These laws are managed by the relevant states.
