     </p>
     <p>
      Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd has signed up to a second Proactive Compliance Deed (PCD) with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company places high priority on continuous improvement and has welcomed the opportunity to continue to work closely with the Fair Work Ombudsman to ensure ongoing compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domino’s and its franchisees employ almost 12,000 full-time and casual employees across 500 stores in Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since signing its first PCD in December, 2011, the Fair Work Ombudsman has observed the company “undertaking responsive, self-regulated compliance activities which have improved the way in which it manages workplace relations both internally and externally.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the terms of the new Deed, Domino’s will continue to ensure that it complies at all times and in all respects with relevant Commonwealth workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company will also continue to provide appropriate guidance and training to its franchisees to ensure they understand their workplace obligations and the importance of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has agreed to refer any new complaints it receives to Domino’s to allow the company or its franchisees to resolve them at the workplace level.
     </p>
     <p>
      It has, however, reserved the right to investigate matters considered to be serious or in the public interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of its obligations under the terms of its first PCD, self-auditing by Domino’s resulted in the return of more than $588,000 to 1,600 underpaid delivery drivers throughout Australia (see

      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James today acknowledged Domino’s positive and co-operative approach to ongoing compliance, saying it showed corporate responsibility to a large number of employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Deeds are a valuable way for us to engage with employers who want to do the right thing and we commend Domino’s for renewing its partnership with us,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers who care about their reputation should be doing these sorts of things.”
