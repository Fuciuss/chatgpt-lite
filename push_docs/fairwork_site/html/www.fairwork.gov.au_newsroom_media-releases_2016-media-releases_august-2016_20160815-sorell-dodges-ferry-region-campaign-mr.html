      <strong>
       15 August 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of a recent campaign in
      <strong>
       Tasmania’s
      </strong>
      Sorell/Dodges Ferry region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spot checks of 50 employers found that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       43 (86 per cent) were paying their employees correctly,
      </li>
      <li>
       43 (86 per cent) were compliant with record-keeping and pay-slip requirements,
      </li>
      <li>
       37 (74 per cent) were compliant with all their workplace responsibilities.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Five businesses were asked to back-pay a total of $5867 to 21 of their employees who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the campaign was conducted in response to a 63 per cent increase in requests for assistance received from employees working in the region between 2011 and 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says there was a high contravention rate recorded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses audited were randomly selected across various industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says Fair Work inspectors noted that businesses which were members of industry or employer organisations had a higher compliance rate than those which were not.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, larger businesses had a higher compliance rate than smaller businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says those businesses with contraventions co-operated with the Agency and rectified them immediately.
     </p>
     <p>
      "One of the aims of the campaign was to ensure employers were aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to understand and comply with them," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are committed to creating a culture of compliance in Australian workplaces."
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors informed employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
