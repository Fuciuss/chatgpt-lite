       The Fair Work Ombudsman and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) will jointly audit 50 businesses in Brisbane as part of a new campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Agencies will visit businesses in the
       <strong>
        Brisbane CBD
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Fortitude Valley
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        South Brisbane
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        West End
       </strong>
       on May 30 and 31.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors will check employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be monitored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       ASIC analysts will c
      </span>
      <span>
       onduct site visits of incorporated entities where directors are present; educate and raise awareness with small business about their compliance obligations as directors of incorporated entities and promote the tools and resources that ASIC has available for small business.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The visits have been co-ordinated in order to minimise the time impact on small businesses, which would otherwise face separate visits from the two Agencies. The campaign is focusing on employers across various sectors, including retail, hospitality, fast food and real estate and businesses have been notified of the visits in advance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Businesses will be randomly selected but there will be a focus on businesses with first-time company directors, to ensure they understand their lawful obligations and
      </span>
      <span>
       develop good compliance habits from an early stage.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Inspectors will offer tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure employers get things right in the future.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer said: “We recognise that in today's economic environment, some small businesses may feel challenged simply keeping track of their obligations, and that's why we seek to provide assistance in ensuring they can keep up to date and compliant without undue impact on the business.”
