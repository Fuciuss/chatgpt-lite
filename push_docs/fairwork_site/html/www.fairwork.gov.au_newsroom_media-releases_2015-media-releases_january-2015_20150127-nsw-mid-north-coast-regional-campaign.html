      The Fair Work Ombudsman will visit the NSW Mid-North Coast over the next few weeks to help raise awareness among employers of their obligations under federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will call on up to 300 businesses in
      <strong>
       Taree,
      </strong>
      <strong>
       Gloucester
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Port Macquarie
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the aim is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how her Agency can assist businesses to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important we check that workers are receiving their correct entitlements but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers in this region understand their obligations,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign will prioritise industries which generate the most requests for assistance from employers on the Mid-North Coast – including road freight transport, accommodation, cafes and restaurants, hairdressing, beauty services and the takeaway food industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will check that employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and are providing meal breaks. Compliance with record-keeping and pay slip obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says inspectors will work with employers in the region to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      In partnership with the Gloucester Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Fair Work inspectors will conduct an information seminar at the Gloucester Bowls Club tomorrow night (Wed, Jan 28), from 6 pm.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Seminar will focus on the free tools and resources available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au to assist employers understand and comply with their obligations.
