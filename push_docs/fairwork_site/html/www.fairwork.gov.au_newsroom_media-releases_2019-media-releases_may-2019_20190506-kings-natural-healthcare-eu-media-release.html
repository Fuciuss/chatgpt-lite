      The operator of three massage centres in Hobart will overhaul its workplace practices after the Fair Work Ombudsman found it underpaid 22 employees a total of $39,830.
     </p>
     <p>
      King’s Natural Healthcare Pty Ltd, which trades as King’s Day Spa and Massage, and company director Yu ‘Sam’ Wang, have entered into a Court-Enforceable Undertaking.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors investigated the company’s massage centres in the
      <strong>
       Hobart CBD
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Rosny Park
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Glenorchy
      </strong>
      after receiving a request for assistance from an employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found that workers were paid a percentage of each massage they provided to customers between 15 January 2018 and 11 March 2018, rather than the lawful minimum wage for each hour worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      This resulted in underpayment of the minimum weekly wage, overtime rates, casual loadings and penalty rates for weekend and public holiday work they were entitled to under the
      <em>
       Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2010
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also failed to issue pay slips to employees, in breach of the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said it was particularly concerning that affected employees were migrant workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Many of the underpaid staff at King’s Day Spa and Massage centres were international students who can be particularly vulnerable due to visa status,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This hefty back payment bill should serve as a warning that is unlawful to pay migrant workers a so-called ‘market rate’ that undercuts the applicable minimum Award rates.”
     </p>
     <p>
      "Every employee has the same workplace rights, regardless of their citizenship, and Australia’s minimum Award rates are not negotiable,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Court-Enforceable Undertaking, King’s Natural Healthcare must rectify all underpayments by 28 June 2019 and donate $5,000 to the Tasmanian Migrant Resource Centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company must also engage an external professional to complete two audits of the pay and conditions of all employees, apologise to workers and display public and workplace notices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, Kings Natural Healthcare must inform the Fair Work Ombudsman if it engages any independent contractors to perform duties also completed by employees.
