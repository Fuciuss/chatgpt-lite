      Half of Barossa businesses are committing at least one breach of workplace laws, according to a report released by the Fair Work Ombudsman today.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of a proactive campaign, Fair Work Ombudsman Inspectors assessed the time-and-wages records of 70 businesses in the
      <strong>
       Barossa
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Two Wells/Gawler
      </strong>
      regions, focusing on towns including
      <strong>
       Nuriootpa
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Williamstown
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Angaston
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Lyndoch.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found that 50 per cent of the businesses were not complying with all of their obligations under Australia’s workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign found that 30 per cent of businesses were not paying their employees correctly, while 31 per cent were not meeting pay slip and record-keeping requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to the breaches, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued seven infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) and three formal cautions.
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of $11,438 was recovered for 12 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said it was just not good enough for half of the businesses across the regions to be breaching their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I urge all employers to make use of the wealth of information and resources we have available at www.fairwork.gov.au to help them understand workplace requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are here to help any business who needs assistance to ensure they are complying with the law.”
     </p>
     <p>
      In one matter, a small retail establishment in
      <strong>
       Angaston
      </strong>
      was issued with a formal caution after inspectors found it was paying a casual employee a flat hourly rate of $20, which was an underpayment of $3.74 per hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      When inspectors asked for records, the employer said that while they kept time-and-wage books, they did not provide pay slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer was educated about pay slips and minimum wage requirements and cooperated with the Fair Work Ombudsman to back-pay the workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is imperative for employers to make sure they are fully aware of their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Ignorance is no excuse when it comes to employers making sure they are doing the right thing by their workers,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Failing to meet workplace obligations can lead to fines, hefty back-payment bills and, in the most serious cases, litigation in court.
     </p>
     <p>
      “With a full range of free resources and advice available on our website, businesses have no excuses for non-compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I encourage employers to visit our website to
      <a href="/my-account/registerpage.aspx">
       register
      </a>
      for a free ‘My Account’ to receive tailored information on workplace laws, and to contact us if they require assistance.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says non-compliant businesses in the region are now on notice that future breaches will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “My agency will be checking in on non-compliant businesses to ensure they have rectified any issues and have processes in place to ensure compliance in the future,” she said.
