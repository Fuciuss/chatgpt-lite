      Our role in workplace problems
     </h2>
     <p>
      As the Fair Work Ombudsman, we:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       monitor compliance with the Fair Work Act
      </li>
      <li>
       investigate and inquire about alleged breaches of the Act
      </li>
      <li>
       take enforcement action when appropriate.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We’re impartial, which means we don’t represent employees or employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      We don’t handle all kinds of workplace problems. We can help with workplace issues related to the Fair Work Act including about awards and agreements. These are usually related to pay and other conditions of employment such as leave, notice and hours of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Help with other kinds of workplace problems, such as health and safety and unfair dismissal, is the role of other organisations.
     </p>

      Once you’ve asked for our help, we follow the steps below to decide what action, if any, we will take.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are guided by the following factors when making our decision:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the kinds of issues raised

     <h3>
      Step 1 – We’ll take a statement about the issues
     </h3>
     <p>
      One of our officers will call you to discuss your situation in more detail. The officer will take a statement about the issues raised and will ask you about the evidence you have to support your statement.
     </p>
     <p>
      We’ll provide you with a copy of the recorded statement and we’ll ask you to confirm that the information is a true and accurate account of your conversation with the officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      In most cases, we’ll also contact the other side and offer them an opportunity to record their own statement.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Step 2 – We’ll inform you about possible next steps
     </h3>
     <p>
      We will let you know the most likely next steps based on the information the officer has gathered. This will include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an overview of the facts raised
      </li>
      <li>
       the issues raised and our preliminary assessment of those issues including a summary of possible next steps
      </li>
      <li>
       how the parties can take alternative action if they choose to.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Step 3 – We’ll make a decision about our involvement in your matter
     </h3>

      We use the information gathered and our

      We inform you and the other party of our decision. As part of this, we’ll outline:

     <ul>
      <li>
       all the relevant facts available at the time of making our decision

      If we decide to take action, a Fair Work Inspector will contact you to discuss next steps.

      If we can’t take further action, or decide not to, we’ll discuss what other options are available for you.

       Example: Process for assessing whether FWO can help with a workplace problem
      </h3>
      <p>
       Khaled worked 2 shifts as a casual waiter for a café but wasn’t paid for them. When he contacted his employer to check when he would be paid, the employer told him he had to return an apron first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Khaled told the employer he didn’t have the apron and that he wanted to be paid for the shifts he worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Khaled read the advice on our website about addressing problems in the workplace and followed the steps. Khaled’s employer still wouldn’t pay him for his shifts, so Khaled called us to ask for our help.
      </p>
      <p>
       An adviser spoke to Khaled and after asking some preliminary questions advised they would refer the issues raised for further assessment. They advised Khaled that he would be contacted by a FWO officer who would request more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       A FWO officer then contacted Khaled and worked with him on a statement so he could confirm that the information he provided to us was true and correct. The FWO officer also asked Khaled to send us his contract of employment and timesheet to show he had worked the 2 shifts, which Khaled did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FWO officer then contacted Khaled’s employer to take their statement in response to Khaled’s allegations. The employer admitted he hadn’t paid Khaled but that he would pay Khaled for the 2 shifts he worked. Khaled’s employer paid him $700 in outstanding wages.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FWO officer confirmed the payment had been made with Khaled and the matter was closed.
