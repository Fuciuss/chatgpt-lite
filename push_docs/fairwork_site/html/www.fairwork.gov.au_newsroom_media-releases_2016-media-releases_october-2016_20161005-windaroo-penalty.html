      The operators of a general medical practice south of Brisbane have been penalised more than $51,000 for subjecting an Indian-trained doctor to “appalling” treatment after he complained to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Windaroo Medical Surgery Pty Ltd, located at
      <strong>
       Loganholme
      </strong>
      Shopping Village, has been penalised $39,600 in the Federal Circuit Court for threatening the doctor to try to coerce him into withdrawing the complaint – and then cutting off his pay when he refused.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, company director Dr Sheila Pathmanathan has been penalised $7920 for her part in the threat and cutting-off the doctor’s pay – and fellow director Dr Tan Thi Thanh Tran has been penalised $3960 for threatening the doctor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has also ordered Windaroo Medical Surgery and Dr Pathmanathan to jointly pay the doctor $24,724 compensation for economic loss and distress suffered.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties and compensation order are the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the outcome of the matter sends a message that retaliating against a worker simply for exercising a workplace right is serious conduct that will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is completely unacceptable and unlawful for an organisation to seek retribution because a worker has exercised their legal right to lodge a complaint with the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against any organisation that unlawfully threatens and coerces workers.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Indian doctor came to Australia in 2009 on a medical practitioner visa to work at Windaroo Medical Surgery and lodged a complaint with the Fair Work Ombudsman in December that year after a dispute with the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Michael Jarrett found that Dr Pathmanathan, Dr Tran and Windaroo breached a coercion provision of the Fair Work Act in February, 2010 by threatening the doctor that he would not be paid unless he withdrew his complaint.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett also found that Windaroo and Dr Pathmanathan took unlawful adverse action against the doctor by ceasing payments to him a month later, after he refused to withdraw the complaint.
     </p>
     <p>
      The doctor resigned in May, 2010 and returned to India with his young family.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett described the treatment of the doctor as “appalling” and found that it had caused him distress.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett said Windaroo, Dr Pathmanathan and Dr Tran knew the doctor was in “significant financial difficulty” and that withholding payments from him would “add to his financial distress”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It was done either in the hope that (the doctor) would relent and withdraw his complaint, or as punishment for not succumbing to the earlier coercion,” Judge Jarrett said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett described the attempt to coerce the doctor as a serious contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      “To coerce a person into withdrawing a complaint made to the Fair Work Ombudsman in exchange for something to which they were in any event entitled is a gross contravention of s.343 of the Act,’’ Judge Jarrett said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is not difficult to infer that the contravention was designed with the explicit intent of avoiding scrutiny by the regulatory authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The contraventions were clearly a deliberate attempt to deprive (the doctor) of his right to bring a complaint to the Fair Work Ombudsman and his right to payments under the contract for services he had with the first respondent.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett found that there had been “no expressions of regret or remorse” from Windaroo, Dr Pathmanathan and Dr Tran.
