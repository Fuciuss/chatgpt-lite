     <p>
      The operator of a remote Northern Territory homestead is facing major penalties after underpaying 17 employees more than $23,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing the Federal Circuit Court is David Mayne Pty Ltd, which trades as the Barkly Homestead, offering accommodation, a restaurant and a roadhouse on the Barkly Highway, about 210 kilometres east of
      <strong>
       Tennant Creek
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing court is homestead manager and part-owner Andrew Mayne.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges 17 employees at the Barkly Homestead were underpaid a total of $23,753 between October 2015 and April 2016, as a result of being paid an inadequate flat rate for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      David Mayne Pty Ltd and Andrew Mayne have made admissions to all alleged contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors conducted a self-initiated audit of the company as part of a regional campaign in Alice Springs and the Barkly Region of the Northern Territory. The full results of the campaign will be published shortly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found that the 17 Barkly Homestead workers, who were engaged on a full-time basis as cleaners, waiters and a gardener, were paid a flat hourly rate of $19.21.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers’ Letter of Offer stated that the flat rate was intended to cover all entitlements, including penalty rates for weekend and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, under the
      <em>
       Hospitality Industry (General) Award 2010
      </em>
      at the time, the employees were entitled to $27.71 for each of the first two hours of overtime and $36.94 for overtime thereafter, Sunday penalty rates of $32.32 and public holiday rates of $46.18.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also failed to pay three of the workers a broken shift allowance required under the Award for days when work periods are broken up by more than three hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Underpayments of individual workers ranged from $623 to $3763.
     </p>
     <p>
      David Mayne Pty Ltd rectified all underpayments after the legal action began.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action was being taken due to the significant underpayments across a relatively short period, and the lack of earlier co-operation from the employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      “With the wealth of free advice and educational material on our website – including in 40 different languages – and the availability of our small business helpline, there is no excuse for employers to make mistakes,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      David Mayne Pty Ltd faces maximum penalties of up to $54,000 per contravention and Andrew Mayne faces penalties of up to $10,800 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also seeks an order for Andrew Mayne to register with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s online My Account portal and complete all education courses for employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter is listed for a penalty hearing in the Federal Circuit Court in Alice Springs on February 20, 2018.
