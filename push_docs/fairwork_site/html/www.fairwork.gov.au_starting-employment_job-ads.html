      Prohibited job ads
     </h2>
     <p>
      Job ads can't include pay rates that are less than employees’ minimum entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      This means that job ads can’t include pay rates that breach:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the Fair Work Act, or
      </li>
      <li>
       a fair work instrument (such as an award or enterprise agreement).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers advertising pieceworker positions where the employee would also be entitled to a periodic pay rate (for example, an hourly or weekly pay rate) need to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       specify the periodic pay rate that applies, or
      </li>
      <li>
       state in the ad that a periodic pay rate will apply.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These rules apply from 7 January 2023, regardless of when the ad was originally posted.

       Example: Job ad with a rate less than the minimum required
      </h3>
      <p>
       Katie is looking for full-time work at a childcare centre. She’s 40-years-old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Katie sees an ad matching her qualifications and experience, offering $16 per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Katie knows that there is an award that covers the childcare industry. She uses our Pay Calculator to work out the pay rate under the Children’s Services Award that would apply to her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Katie finds that the hourly rate offered in the ad is less than the adult pay rate under the Children’s Services Award.
      </p>
      <p>
       The employer who posted the job ad may be breaching the Fair Work Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employers have to ensure that the pay rate for the role advertised is at least the minimum rate in the applicable award, enterprise agreement, or the National Minimum Wage order if there is no applicable award or agreement.

       Example: Reporting a prohibited job ad
      </h3>
      <p>
       Brett is looking for work as a part-time shop assistant. He sees an ad online for a part-time adult retail worker in a clothing store offering $15 per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brett knows that most retail businesses are covered by the Retail Award. He uses our Pay Calculator to check pay rates in the Retail Award and finds that $15 per hour is too low for what an adult part-time employee should be paid under the award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brett is concerned that the job ad isn’t complying with workplace laws. He makes a note of the website address and makes an
       <a href="https://services.fairwork.gov.au/anonymous-report/english-anonymous-report">
        anonymous report
