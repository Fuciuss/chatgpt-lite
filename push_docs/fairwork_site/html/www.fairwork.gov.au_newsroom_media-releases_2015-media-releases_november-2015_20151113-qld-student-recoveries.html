      <strong>
       13 November 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
      </strong>
      A group of teenage high school students in
      <strong>
       Queensland
      </strong>
      has been short-changed thousands of dollars for work they undertook as part of school-based traineeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Year 11 and 12 students, aged between 15 and 18, were placed with local employers by a Gold Coast-based group training organisation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The placements assist students attain a nationally-recognised Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualification, as well as their Higher School Certificate (HSC).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The 20 students, from schools in
       <strong>
        Brisbane
       </strong>
       and from both the
       <strong>
        Gold Coast
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Sunshine Coast
       </strong>
       ,   were collectively underpaid almost $28,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Twelve students in Brisbane have been back-paid $16,000, five students on the Gold Coast have been reimbursed $6300 and three students on the Sunshine Coast have been returned $5500.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the underpayments after being approached by students, their parents and the State Department of Education and Training.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The group training organisation administered vocational courses for students at their schools, including traineeships in a range of disciplines.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A component of the traineeships involved the students working one day a week over several months last year at sporting organisations, schools, retail outlets and childcare centres.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The businesses were “hosts” only, and the training organisation, as the employer, was responsible for ensuring the students, as part-time employees, received their minimum wages and entitlements for work they performed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, the organisation, which received public funding to administer the training, failed to pay the students any wages at all for many of the hours they worked.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The organisation also failed to pay the students the small amounts of annual leave entitlements they accrued or penalty rates when they were applicable.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the organisation has now been educated about its obligations under federal workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       While it agreed to promptly reimburse the students all outstanding entitlements, it has received a Letter of Caution and is on notice to ensure its future compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James urged Queensland employers uncertain about their workplace obligations to contact the Agency for assistance and advice they can rely on with confidence.
