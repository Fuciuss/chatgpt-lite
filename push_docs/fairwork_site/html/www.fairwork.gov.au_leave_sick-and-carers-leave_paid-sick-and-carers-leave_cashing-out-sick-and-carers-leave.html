      What conditions apply if cashing out is allowed
     </h2>
     <p>
      Sick and carer's leave if allowed by an award or registered agreement, can only be cashed out if all the following conditions are met:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a separate agreement is made in writing each time leave is cashed out
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee has a balance of at least 15 days of untaken paid sick and carer's leave after cashing out
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee is paid at least the full amount they would have been paid if they actually took the leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employee can't cash out their built-up sick and carer's leave if these conditions aren't met.
