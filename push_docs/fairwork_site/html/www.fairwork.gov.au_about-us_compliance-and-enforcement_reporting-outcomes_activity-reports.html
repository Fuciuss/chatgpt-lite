     </h2>
     <p>
      Release date: November 2019
     </p>
     <p>
      In late 2017, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) investigated cleaning companies working in 10 Victorian Government schools. The cleaning companies were procured directly by the schools via a Department of Education and Training (DET) approved panel of suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      27 employees were underpaid due to being paid a flat rate for all hours worked and/or incorrect penalty rates. The smallest underpayment for a single worker was $26.39, and the highest was $2223.54.
     </p>
     <p>
      We took the following compliance and enforcement actions:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       3 formal cautions
      </li>
      <li>
       14 infringement notices

      United Petroleum retail fuel outlets: Summary of compliance activity outcomes

     <p>
      Release date: April 2017
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO has received a number of requests for assistance from United Petroleum franchise and commission agent employees over the years alleging underpayment of wages and conditions. Following media coverage in September 2015 raising new allegations regarding underpayments, we initiated a compliance activity (the Activity) to assess United Petroleum fuel outlets compliance with workplace laws. The Activity included assessing the level of compliance by United Petroleum, its associated entities, franchisees and commission agents by checking a sample of 12 United Petroleum sites.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Activity found employees of United Petroleum had been underpaid and that United Petroleum did not have any process or system in place to test whether its franchisees or commission agents were paying employees correctly or applying the modern award correctly. The Activity resulted in a number of enforcement outcomes, including 2 enforceable undertakings, 2 compliance notices and 3 letters of caution.

     <p>
      Release date: January 2017
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result of receiving a number of requests for assistance, combined with media coverage in November 2015 about alleged underpayments, we initiated a compliance activity (the Activity) into Pizza Hut’s workplace arrangements with its delivery drivers. We reviewed the records of the 34 randomly selected franchisees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Activity identified a number of issues in franchisees including non-compliance, misclassification of delivery drivers and underpayments, and found that Pizza Hut didn’t have any process or system in place to test whether their franchisees were applying the relevant industrial instrument correctly.  The Activity resulted in a number of enforcement outcomes against 23 non-compliant franchisees as well as the offer of an opportunity to enter into a compliance partnership for the franchisor, Pizza Hut.
