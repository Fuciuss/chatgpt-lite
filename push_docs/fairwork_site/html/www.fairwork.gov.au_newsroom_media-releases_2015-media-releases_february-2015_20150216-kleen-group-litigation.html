       business will face court for failing to co-operate with the Fair Work Ombudsman after it received a complaint from an employee.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Agency has commenced legal proceedings against Henry Andrew Nickolls and his company Kleen Group Pty Ltd, which provides cleaning, building and facilities management and integrated property services.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman sought to engage with Mr Nickolls and Kleen Group after an operations manager complained about being underpaid.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       When efforts to secure co-operation failed, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Notice to Produce (NTP) relevant employment documents within 18 days.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The company allegedly did not comply and failed to respond to further follow-up correspondence.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Notices to Produce issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our inspectors made repeated efforts to engage with this business operator to try to obtain the documents required for our investigation, but were not able to secure sufficient co-operation,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Nickolls faces a penalty of up to $10,200 and his company faces a penalty of up to $51,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In addition, the Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking a Court Order for the company to comply with the Notice to Produce so its investigation can continue.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the proceedings are necessary because enforcing compliance with Notices to Produce is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws and enabling inspectors to conduct thorough investigations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The matter will be heard in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
