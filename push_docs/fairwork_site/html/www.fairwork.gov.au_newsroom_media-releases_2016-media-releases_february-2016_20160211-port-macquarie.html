      <strong>
       11 February 2016
      </strong>

     <p>
      Several workers around
      <strong>
       Port Macquarie
      </strong>
      have been reimbursed almost $24,000 after the Fair Work Ombudsman found they had been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest recovery was almost $10,000 for six workers at
      <strong>
       Wauchope
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were underpaid their minimum hourly rate, industry-based allowances and other entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the underpayments during a random audit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business operator set pay rates to compete with other businesses in the area, rather than checking the minimum legal entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      In another matter, seven employees at another local company were back-paid $6300 after being underpaid minimum hourly rates and overtime rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      And three workers at a fast food outlet
      <strong>
      </strong>
      were back-paid
      <strong>
      </strong>
      $7500 after being underpaid their minimum hourly rates, weekend penalty rates and casual loadings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the cases highlight the importance of Port Macquarie employers understanding the minimum lawful pay rates applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It was pleasing that these employers all agreed to rectify the underpayments after being contacted by Fair Work inspectors," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "When we find errors our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated."
     </p>
     <p>

      <strong>

      </strong>
      for advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      An interpreter service is available on
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses can opt to be put through to a small business helpline, which has assisted more than 290,000 callers since it was established.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tools and resources available on the website include templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
