     </h2>
     <p>
      This is a good way for employees who are caring for a baby or newly adopted child to stay up to date with their workplace, refresh their skills and assist their return to work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Work on a keeping in touch day may include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       participating in a planning day
      </li>
      <li>
       doing training or
      </li>
      <li>
       attending a conference.

      Number of keeping in touch days
     </h2>
     <p>
      An employee on unpaid parental leave gets 10 keeping in touch days. This doesn't affect their unpaid parental leave entitlement.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the employee extends their period of unpaid parental leave beyond 12 months, they can take an additional 10 days.

      When keeping in touch days can be worked
     </h2>
     <p>
      Keeping in touch days can be worked:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       as a part day
      </li>
      <li>
       1 day at a time
      </li>
      <li>
       a few days at a time, or
      </li>
      <li>
       all at once.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A keeping in touch day can be worked at least 42 days after the birth of a child or adoption. It can only be earlier if the employee requests it. If a request is made, a keeping in touch day can't be worked earlier than 14 days after the birth or adoption. The employer and employee have to agree to the keeping in touch days.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee doesn't have to use keeping in touch days if they don't wish to.

       Example: Payment for a keeping in touch day to assist with a return to work
      </h3>
      <p>
       Georgia has taken 12 months unpaid leave to look after her newly adopted son. During this time, her workplace gets a new computer system and everyone needs training in how to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To help Georgia's transition back into work after her leave, her manager Alex asks if she'd like to come in for a keeping in touch day. This means Georgia can do the training with everyone else. Georgia agrees and is paid her normal wage for coming to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       To practice her new skills, she asks Alex if she can come in for a keeping in touch day once a month for 6 months. Alex agrees.
