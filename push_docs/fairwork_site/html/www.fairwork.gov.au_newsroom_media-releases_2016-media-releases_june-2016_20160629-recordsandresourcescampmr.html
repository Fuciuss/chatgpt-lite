     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of recent checks on the record-keeping practices of business throughout Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost 1400 employers were audited in every State and Territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spot checks of 1376 businesses found that 988, or 72 per cent, were compliant with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, 46 employers were asked to back-pay a total of $620,023 to 336 of their workers who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two businesses received a Letter of Caution, putting them on notice that future breaches of workplace laws could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the overall finding of the campaign, run over two years in 2014 and 2015, is pleasing and reflects a general willingness of businesses to do the right thing by their employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says one of the aims of the campaign was to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and to update businesses on how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is heartening to see a relatively high level of compliance from the businesses audited as part of these campaigns,’’ Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important that we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Businesses are required to keep a range of records, and if issues arise, it is usually these records which can show that employees have received their correct entitlements, so we place great importance on correct record-keeping.”
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the campaigns, Fair Work Inspectors provided information to businesses and directed employers to the educational resources available from the Fair Work Ombudsman website www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      The resources include records and pay tools, the award-winning Online Learning Centre and staff management resources such as the Hiring Employees Guide.
