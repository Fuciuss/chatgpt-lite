      <strong>
       10 April 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has fined and admonished a restaurateur at
      <strong>
       Lorne
      </strong>
      , in regional Victoria, over his “disgraceful” treatment of a foreign chef.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Israeli-born chef was underpaid more than $4200 in less than three months in 2012 when he worked at the Saporitalia restaurant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman initiated legal action against part-owner Yoav Oren after his refusal to back-pay the chef his outstanding entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Norah Hartnett has fined Oren a total of $4590, or 90 per cent of the possible maximum penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      And the company which operated the restaurant at the time the chef was underpaid, Darna Pty Ltd, has been fined a further $17,850.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a rare move, Judge Hartnett has also ordered Oren to pay legal costs to the Fair Work Ombudsman of $7843.
     </p>
     <p>
      She found Oren’s conduct throughout the litigation “verged on an abuse of process” and impacted directly on the Agency’s legal costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Hartnett said Oren had shown “a blatant disregard and contempt” for Australian workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      She also noted Oren’s “complete lack of contrition” for his behaviour, observing that he had been “almost completely unco-operative” with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, Judge Hartnett found Oren had adopted an “antagonistic approach” to the litigation, which included making unfounded allegations against his former chef.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oren had made remarks in submissions that were “at times offensive” and “expressed an intention to make the proceedings a personal conflict”.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Hartnett found that Oren’s treatment of the employee was “disgraceful and continues in the unsubstantiated and appalling criticism of him to this day”.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chef now works in Melbourne.
     </p>
     <p>
      She found that Oren continued to show a complete lack of understanding of workplace relations law or any determination to comply with them.
     </p>
     <p>
      “There is defiance, disbelief and aggression in place of a skerrick of contrition,” Judge Hartnett says in her 14-page written judgment.
     </p>
     <p>
      “He has shown no remorse. He has taken no steps to ensure that no further breaches will occur.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Hartnett noted that Oren had failed to explain why ownership of the Saporitalia restaurant was transferred to a new entity ahead of Court penalties being imposed.
     </p>
     <p>
      She also noted that he had not explained why he was winding up Darna Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Hartnett found that Oren’s failure to comply with Fair Work Ombudsman requests to back-pay the chef was “very serious conduct”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “There is a need in the restaurant industry for general deterrence, in particular to other employers who have been issued with Compliance Notices,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must respond to Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors unless they have a reasonable excuse or make a Court application to challenge the Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the Agency prefers to resolve underpayment matters co-operatively with employers, by agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Mr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is prepared to take action against employers who refuse to engage with the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important for employers to understand that when a Compliance Notice is first issued, the Fair Work Ombudsman is simply seeking to recover wages that should have been paid in the first instance - we are not seeking to be punitive,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors are increasingly issuing Compliance Notices in cases where employers with contraventions refuse to co-operate.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Enforcing Compliance Notices is fundamental if we are to maintain the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a particular focus on ensuring that the workplace rights of foreign workers are respected.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Foreign workers can be vulnerable if they aren’t aware of their workplace rights or are reluctant to seek assistance, so we place a high priority on ensuring they receive their full lawful entitlements,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman supports compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces. It provides practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
