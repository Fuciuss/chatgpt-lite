      <strong>
       31 March 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) and a national labour-hire company have been ordered to pay $802,500 in fines and compensation for their part in denying employment to non-union members.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision by the Federal Court in
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      follows legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman against the MUA and Skilled Offshore (Australia) Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has imposed a penalty of $79,200 against the MUA and ordered it to pay $723,300 in compensation to a married Perth couple who were denied employment as a result of not being able to obtain MUA membership.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court found that Skilled Offshore (Australia), previously called Offshore Marine Services Pty Ltd (OMS), implemented a practice whereby membership of the MUA was a prerequisite for employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      It found that this practice led to OMS telling the couple that in order to secure employment as stewards they would have to obtain membership with the MUA.
     </p>
     <p>
      The MUA, with the knowledge of OMS' employment practices, subsequently refused the couple's applications for MUA membership.
     </p>
     <p>
      This ensured the jobs they were applying for at OMS were instead given to existing MUA members. The couple never obtained employment with OMS.
     </p>
     <p>
      Skilled Offshore (Australia) has been ordered to pay the MUA one third of the compensation owed to the couple for its role in denying them employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman initiated legal action against both Skilled Offshore (Australia), then known as OMS, and the MUA in June 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      In May, 2012, OMS was fined $7500 by the Federal Court after admitting its contraventions in the case. The MUA denied liability from the outset, deciding to defend the allegations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Justice John Gilmour found that the MUA‘s conduct “involved its blatant use of illegitimate industrial action power to bully OMS” into refusing to employ the couple.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under workplace laws it is unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ a person based on whether the person is a member of a union.
     </p>
     <p>
      Justice Gilmour found that the MUA’s actions deprived the couple of the opportunity to gain well paid employment “at a critical time of their lives” and that OMS “succumbed” to union threats of industrial action, even though it wanted to employ the couple.
     </p>
     <p>
      He noted that “engaging in conduct with an intention to enforce a closed shop” on the Western Australian waterfront was “objectively serious”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The penalties must be sufficient to deter the MUA from engaging in further unlawful conduct of this type,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court’s decision sends a strong message that enforcing a ‘closed shop’ is completely unacceptable in today’s workplace environment.
      <br/>
      “Employees have the right to join or not join a union and this should not have any bearing on their ability to seek paid employment,” Ms James said.
