      <strong>
       15 April 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will audit 30 businesses in Alice Springs and the Barkly Region of the Northern Territory as part of a new campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two-month campaign will focus on businesses in the accommodation and food services, nursing, farming, retail and construction sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will check employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      All businesses will be randomly selected. Key local employer groups and unions have been enlisted to help the Agency promote the campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said. “Inspectors will offer tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure employers get things right in the future.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers must make an effort to ensure they understand the minimum wages applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      “If employers are paying an adult worker less than $17.29 an hour for normal hours worked, they should check with us immediately,” she said. “Minimum pay rates are non-negotiable and they apply to everyone regardless of nationality and visa status.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, and a Pay and Conditions Tool.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small business operators can also tap in to the suite of easy-to-follow courses at the Fair Work Ombudsman Online Learning Centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      The free courses provide advice and guidance on issues including difficult conversations in the workplace, starting a new job, hiring employees and managing performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit the website or call the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94. An interpreter service is also available by calling 13 14 50.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses calling the Infoline can opt to receive priority service to assist with their inquiries.
