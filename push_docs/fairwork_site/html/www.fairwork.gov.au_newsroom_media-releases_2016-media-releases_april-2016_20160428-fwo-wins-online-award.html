      <strong>
       28 April 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has become the only Australian organisation to receive one of the world’s most prestigious online design honours in the legal field.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency's Online Learning Centre at www.fairwork.gov.au
      <strong>
      </strong>
      received "Best in Class" status in the legal category of the Interactive Media Awards.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Awards recognise the highest standards of excellence in web design and development and honour individuals and organisations for their outstanding achievement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is among an elite group of 10 - and the only non-law firm - in the legal category to achieve the status in 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Online Learning Centre ranked highly in design, content, feature functionality, usability and compliance with a score of 490 out of 500.
     </p>
     <p>
      Elements that impressed the judges included the site's video, links and tools and ease of finding information, completing tasks and using multiple browsers.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This site represents the highest standards of professionalism, standards compliance and impeccable planning and execution," Award organisers said. "This is one of the world's most well executed websites."
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the honour recognises the professionalism, talent and creativity at the Fair Work Ombudsman and digital company 2and2.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Their work has enabled the Fair Work Ombudsman to present the Online Learning Centre as an accessible platform that assists workers and employers with their workplace issues," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The online courses provide an opportunity to learn new skills and strategies about having difficult conversations in the workplace, hiring employees, preparing for a new job, promoting good performance and dealing with underperformance if it occurs.
     </p>
     <p>
      "For the Fair Work Ombudsman to be the only government body to rank so highly in the legal category with international law firms from the United States, Italy and Canada speaks volumes of the competencies of our staff and 2and2."
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman was also awarded 'Gold' in the 2014 Brandon Hall Awards, which recognise excellence in online learning course design.
