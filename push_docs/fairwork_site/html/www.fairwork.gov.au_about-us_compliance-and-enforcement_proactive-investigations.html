      What is a proactive investigation?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Our proactive investigations focus on industries, regions or workplaces that need extra help to comply with Australian workplace laws. We use intelligence including anonymous tip-offs and requests for assistance data to plan investigations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A proactive investigation is a tailored program of work where we engage with workplaces in particular industries, regions, franchise or supply chain networks to assess compliance with Australian workplace laws. We work with employers to help them identify compliance issues and meet their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proactive investigations are designed in response to information gathered from a range of sources, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       research we undertake about particular industries and regions
      </li>
      <li>
       information and intelligence we gather from:
       <ul class="secondLevel" style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>
         our own enquiries, anonymous tip-off and compliance data
        </li>
        <li>
         the Australian community
        </li>
        <li>
         employees and employers
        </li>
        <li>
         industry associations
        </li>
        <li>
         government agencies
        </li>
        <li>
         the media.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Activities that can form part of a proactive investigation include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       requesting and checking employment records to make sure businesses are complying with Australian workplace laws
      </li>
      <li>
       visiting workplaces to talk to employers and employees and check records
      </li>
      <li>
       asking employers to fix problems if we find them
      </li>
      <li>
       educating employers and employees about their rights and obligations
      </li>
      <li>
       developing and providing employers with tools and resources they need to help them understand and meet their obligations
      </li>
      <li>
       working with industry associations and employers to let them know how they can maintain compliant workplaces.
