     <p class="intro">
      Sham contracting happens when an employer attempts to disguise an employment relationship as an independent contracting arrangement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee may be treated like an independent contractor, for example, the business they are working for asks them to provide an ABN and submit invoices for their work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sometimes, an employee can be misclassified as an independent contractor. Check what you can do if you think you're an employee, not a contractor.

         Working out whether or not someone is an employee or an independent contractor can be a complex legal decision and can have consequences, for example, about how much tax you need to pay or how much super you need to get. In some instances, you may want to get legal advice.

       Best practice tip
      </h3>
      <p>
       Before speaking to the business you should work out whether or not you are being underpaid as an employee. In some cases, although a person may have been incorrectly classified as a contractor and sham contracting may be occurring, a person may still be getting paid more than they would be entitled to as an employee. In that case, there may be no back pay applicable.

      Determining whether you’ve been correctly classified as a contractor or an employee and whether there is sham contracting can be complicated. You may want to get independent legal advice if you’re having difficulty working out these issues.
