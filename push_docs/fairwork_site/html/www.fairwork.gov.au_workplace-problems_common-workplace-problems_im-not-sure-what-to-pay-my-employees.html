      Not knowing what to pay staff can be a common problem for employers. Finding out whether an award applies to your business, and which classification your employees are, is critical to getting your employee’s entitlements right.
     </p>
     <p>
      Not knowing the law can create problems for your workplace and lead to serious penalties.

      Steps to take
     </h3>
     <p>
      <strong>
       1. Work out which award or agreement applies
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       If your business has a registered
       <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3a20979-eb6b-4262-a537-1cc152ed90c6" href="/employment-conditions/agreements" title="Agreements">

       2. Use our Pay and Conditions Tool

       Use our

       3. Read the award in more detail

       4. Sit down and talk to your employee
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       If you and your employee disagree about which classification applies to them, you should sit down together and read through the duties of the role and the classification list in the award.
      </li>
      <li>
       The level that most closely aligns with their duties will apply. Things such as years of experience or a formal qualification may make a difference to the classification. This will be outlined in the award.

       5. Stay up to date with changes
