      <strong>
       3 April 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      man Kia Silverbrook and three companies he has operated, alleging 21 employees are owed more than $870,000 in wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      In three separate legal proceedings filed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Priority Matters Pty Ltd, which processes patent applications for inventions, underpaid 15 employees a total of $452,997,
      </li>
      <li>
       Geneasys Pty Ltd, a medical research and development company, underpaid five employees a total of $362,973, and
      </li>
      <li>
       Superlattice Solar Pty Ltd, a solar cell research company, underpaid one employee $55,969.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Mr Silverbrook - who was allegedly responsible for the overall direction, management and supervision of operations at the three companies - is also a respondent to each of the Fair Work Ombudsman's legal proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Engineers, scientists, patent attorneys, patent assistants and patent design assistants are among those who were allegedly underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman says one employee is owed $166,914.
     </p>
     <p>
      It claims the underpayments are primarily the result of employees not being paid any wages for periods of work ranging from a week or more to several months between February and August last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Court papers allege that when some employees queried Mr Silverbrook about why their wages had not been paid, he told staff that the three companies did not have the necessary funds to pay wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees were also variously underpaid amounts of public holiday pay, casual loadings, annual leave entitlements, termination entitlements, redundancy pay and safety net contractual entitlements, according to Court documents.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the alleged underpayments when it investigated complaints lodged by employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the quantum of the alleged non-payment of wages over an extended period of time and the employer's failure to rectify them - despite efforts by inspectors to resolve the matter - are significant factors in the decision to place the matter before court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Geneasys Pty Ltd has recently been placed into liquidation, resulting in the Fair Work Ombudsman's legal proceedings against the company being automatically stayed. However, the legal proceedings against Mr Silverbrook in relation to this matter are continuing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Silverbrook faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per breach in each of the three matters, while Priority Matters Pty Ltd and Superlattice Solar Pty Ltd each face penalties up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for back-payments to the allegedly underpaid employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directions hearings are listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney today.
