      <strong>
       4 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The manager of a business in
      <strong>
       Hobart
      </strong>
      has been back-paid almost $22,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The male employee had worked for the business for more than eight years, but was not paid his accrued annual leave entitlements when his job was terminated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The man waited six months for his former employer to pay his outstanding entitlements, but when it did not, he contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors subsequently spoke to the business to explain its obligations under workplace laws and negotiated a settlement of $21,715.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business avoided enforcement action by co-operating with the Agency and promptly correcting the underpayment.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, seven workers at a
      <strong>
       Hobart
      </strong>
      fast food outlet have been back-paid $8189 after underpayments were identified as part of the Agency's national hospitality campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The seven were being underpaid their minimum hourly rates because the employer was inadvertently applying the Restaurant Industry Award instead of the Fast Food Industry Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest single underpayment was $1973.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist Tasmanian employers unsure of their workplace obligations, and encouraged them to use free tools and resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says the Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is important that there be a fair, competitive environment for employers who are doing the right thing by creating a level playing field in relation to business costs," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Anyone operating a business needs to ensure they take the time to understand the workplace laws applicable to their business."
     </p>
     <p>
