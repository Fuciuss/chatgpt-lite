      Twenty three workers in Victoria’s
      <strong>
       Goulburn Valley
      </strong>
      region have been back-paid more than $34,000 in wages and entitlements after seeking assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      In one matter, a worker at an automotive repair and maintenance business in
      <strong>
       Kyabram
      </strong>
      was dismissed without being paid his lawful entitlements of notice of termination, annual leave and long service leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman intervened and the business agreed to pay the employee an amount of $11,602.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, a full-time employee in
      <strong>
       Kyabram
      </strong>
      who was made redundant was not given redundancy payments as his employer believed the small business was exempt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Building and Construction On-site Award 2010
      </em>
      , the business was required to pay the employee redundancy payments upon the termination.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman, the business cooperated and back-paid the employee $8,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      In another matter, the agency assisted 19 wait staff at a
      <strong>
       Shepparton
      </strong>
      restaurant who had been underpaid a combined $8,207. Ten of these employees were aged between 16 and 19.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer had misclassified the workers as level 1 staff and paid them accordingly rather than at the level 2 rates they were entitled to under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      After being contacted by the Fair Work Ombudsman and informed of the appropriate classification, the business fully cooperated and rectified all underpayments promptly.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a third matter, two apprentices working as electrical contractors in the
      <strong>
       Cobram
      </strong>
      area were underpaid $6,725. The underpayments were caused by the employer failing to pay both the correct hourly rate and the applicable industry allowances under the
      <em>
       Electrical, Electronic and Communications Contracting Award 2010
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said each business was now on notice that further mistakes could result in serious enforcement action, such as litigation and the potential for hefty penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      "There is a wealth of free advice and educational material on our website and we have a dedicated small business infoline so there is absolutely no excuse for making these mistakes," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "In each of these cases it was the first time the business had come to our attention and each quickly rectified the issues so we determined that lengthy court proceedings were not necessary in these circumstances." Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "However, we revisit businesses that have been found non-compliant and these operators have been warned that if they continue to make mistakes, they can expect to be subject to court proceedings or an enforceable undertaking."
