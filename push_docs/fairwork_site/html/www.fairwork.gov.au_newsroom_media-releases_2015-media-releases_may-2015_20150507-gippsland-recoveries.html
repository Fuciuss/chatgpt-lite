      <strong>
       7 May 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Did you hear the one about the boss who hired one of his mates as a tradesman, but then underpaid him $25,000 over the next three years?
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker was often paid only a fraction of the wages he was entitled to – and sometimes went for weeks without any wages at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      But he kept working under the presumption he would eventually be paid in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      He was reluctant to raise the issue with his boss, as he worried it would damage their long-term friendship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sometimes, the worker was forced to borrow money from his boss to make ends meet.
     </p>
     <p>
      He was always required to pay it back, even though his wages remained outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eventually, the worker turned to the Fair Work Ombudsman for help.
     </p>
     <p>
      When approached by Fair Work inspectors, the employer blamed cash-flow problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      But he wanted to do the right thing, so he sold his truck and used the proceeds to back-pay his “mate” everything he was owed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business has since closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is unknown if the two men remain friends.
     </p>
     <p>
      The above is a true story.
     </p>
     <p>
      It happened recently at
      <strong>
       Maffra
      </strong>
      , in Victoria’s
      <strong>
       Gippsland
      </strong>
      region.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It must have been a very awkward situation for the employee, both in terms of loyalty to his mate and his finances,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employees should not be put in a position where they struggle to pay their bills because they haven’t been paid the correct wages on time.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Imagine being underpaid such a large amount of money and feeling uncomfortable to raise it because your boss is also your mate."
     </p>
     <p>
      “Some might say this boss deliberately took advantage of his employee because the two were friends.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says few people are unlikely to make it through their working lives – whether as an employee or a manager – without the need to have a difficult conversation at work.
     </p>
     <p>
      “No matter what the issue is, it’s important to deal with it straight away, rather than allowing the issue to linger and potentially worsen,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our experience suggests that when workplace issues are left unresolved or handled poorly, they can cause considerable harm to staff morale, workplace culture and productivity – resulting in absenteeism and higher employee turnover.
     </p>
     <p>
      “However, when difficult conversations are executed quickly and successful outcomes are achieved, it can improve staff engagement and confidence and create a happier, more productive workplace.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has developed a range of interactive courses for employees and employers, available on its
      <a href="/tools-and-resources/online-learning-centre/default">
       Online Learning Centre
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <em>
       “Having difficult conversations at work”
      </em>
      course can be accessed at www.fairwork.gov.au/learning.
     </p>
     <p>
      It aims to assist employees talk to their manager about things like getting the right pay, taking leave and changing their hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is always looking for new and innovative ways to help employees and employers understand and comply with their respective rights and obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses can now access a dedicated Small Business Helpline where they will receive priority service from the Agency’s award-winning Fair Work Infoline advisers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman provides practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply in support of encouraging compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries in the Gippsland area include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $6700 for 12 employees at a
       <strong>
        Wonthaggi
       </strong>
       business underpaid their minimum casual engagement periods and hourly rates, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5500 for 22 workers at a
       <strong>
        Lakes Entrance
       </strong>
       hospitality business underpaid the minimum hourly rate and late-night penalty rates.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says while it was disappointing to identify the underpayments, it was pleasing to see the employers co-operate with Fair Work inspectors and back-pay the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and assisting them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the overwhelming majority of employers want to do the right thing by their employees and get it right when it comes to workplace laws.
