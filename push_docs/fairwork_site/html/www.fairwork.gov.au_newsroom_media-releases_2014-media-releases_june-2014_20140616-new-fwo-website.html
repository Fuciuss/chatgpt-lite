      The Fair Work Ombudsman today launched a new website aimed at busy people who need accurate information quickly and conveniently.
     </p>
     <p>
      And from today, employees and employers can access reliable workplace relations information tailored to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace information can now be sourced from a fresh-look www.fairwork.gov.au
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is committed to providing advice, information and assistance that people can rely on with confidence, and the new website allows users to nominate the industry they work in and as they search the site information will be tailored to reflect their circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers will be able to create their own individual accounts and save relevant data, such as pay rates, which they can access at their convenience.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This is a resource for employers and employees and it was created with relevance to the user at the forefront of the design. We want people to be able to get the information they need in a fast and convenient way,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Once people identify themselves, no matter where they go on the website, the information will be filtered based on what applies to their workplace or their job,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      With more than 10 million visits a year, the Fair Work Ombudsman website is already a popular resource for advice and assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the new website will assist people with basic information, but also provide tools and resources for those who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, the site now features an interactive Online Learning Centre, which has already attracted more than 10,000 users.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with information on which they can act helps to create fair and productive workplaces. It gives employers confidence they are meeting their obligations, and employees confidence they are getting paid correctly,” Ms James said.
