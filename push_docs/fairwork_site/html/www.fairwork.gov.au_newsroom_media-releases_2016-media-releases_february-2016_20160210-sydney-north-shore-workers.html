      <strong>
       10 February 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A business on Sydney’s north shore has back-paid three young employees almost $35,000 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <strong>
       Pymble
      </strong>
      employer first hired the three female workers when they were 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      For six years, the young workers were paid flat hourly rates below the minimum hourly wage rates they should have received.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were underpaid $15,855, $13,590 and $5516 respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business told Fair Work inspectors it was not aware of the extent of its obligations under federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer co-operated with inspectors and reimbursed all money owed.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Businesses need to ensure they understand the wage rates applicable to their business, including penalty rates for overtime, weekend and evening shifts,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We know workplace laws can be complicated for the uninitiated, but we ask businesses to use the tools and resources that we provide for them.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are committed to helping employers understand and comply with workplace laws, but operators need to make an effort to get the basics right in the first place.”
     </p>
     <p>
      She encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about their workplace practices to visit the website at www.fairwork.gov.au or phone the Fair Work Infoline on

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      An interpreter service is available by calling
      <strong>

      </strong>
      and information on the website is translated into 27 languages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small business can opt to be put through to a small business helpline, which has now assisted more than 290,000 callers since it was established.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman recently introduced a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT), which provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements. Free templates for pay slips and time-and-wage-records are also available on the website.
