      Membership of a union
     </h2>
     <p>
      All employees and independent contractors are free to choose to join or not join a union. This is also known as freedom of association.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's illegal for a person to pressure another person about their choice to join or not join a union. For example:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an employer can't pressure an employee
      </li>
      <li>
       a business can't pressure an independent contractor working with them.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It’s also illegal to take or threaten to take adverse action against a person for:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       being or not being a union member
      </li>
      <li>
       taking part or not taking part in industrial activity, or
      </li>
      <li>
       choosing to be represented, or not to be represented, by a union.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An adverse action against a person includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       dismissing them
      </li>
      <li>
       refusing to employ them
      </li>
      <li>
       changing their role to put them in a worse position
      </li>
      <li>
       changing their terms and conditions to put them in a worse position
      </li>
      <li>
       discriminating between them and other employees.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Freedom of association also extends to employers. They can choose whether to join an employer association or not.
