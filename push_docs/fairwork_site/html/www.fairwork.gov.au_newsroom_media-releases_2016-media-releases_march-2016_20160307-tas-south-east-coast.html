     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will audit up to 50 businesses across Tasmania’s South-East Coast as part of a new campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign will focus on businesses located in
      <strong>
       Triabunna
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Bicheno
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Swansea
      </strong>
      and run until the end of April.
     </p>
     <p>
      Requests for assistance from employees in the region increased almost 70 per cent between 2011 and 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will check employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers in various industries will be assessed, including accommodation, cafes and restaurants, rock lobster fishing and sheep farming.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses that employ cleaners, sales assistants and farm hands will come under scrutiny.
     </p>
     <p>
      All employers will be randomly selected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Key local employer groups and unions have been enlisted to assist the Agency promote the campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Inspectors will make a number of face-to-face visits to businesses during the campaign so they can offer employers tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future."
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman's website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Resources include templates for time-and-wages records and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about entitlements.
