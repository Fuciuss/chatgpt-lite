       The Fair Work Ombudsman will participate in
       <strong>
        Adelaide’s
       </strong>
       Feast Festival to raise awareness about the workplace rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman staff will talk to festival-goers about issues such as bullying and discrimination and hand-out educative materials on workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       They will also promote awareness of carer’s and parental leave.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman will host a stall at the Feast Festival’s
       <em>
        Picnic in the Park
       </em>
       on the banks of the River Torrens at Pinky Flat, corner War Memorial Drive and Montefiore Road, on Sunday, November 29 between 11am and 6pm.

       Fair Work inspectors have been empowered to investigate allegations of discrimination in the workplace since 2009.
      </span>

       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says everyone is entitled to a supportive workplace free of unlawful discrimination.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We receive very few requests for assistance about discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but this may be due to a lack of awareness, and it is our role to educate the community about its workplace rights and obligations,” Ms James says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Discriminatory behaviour can include changing an employee’s job to their disadvantage, reducing their pay or refusing to hire them on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Any worker who has been subjected to this type of conduct can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for free advice and assistance,” Ms James says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman’s festival participation follows successful involvement in Melbourne’s Midsumma Festival in January.
