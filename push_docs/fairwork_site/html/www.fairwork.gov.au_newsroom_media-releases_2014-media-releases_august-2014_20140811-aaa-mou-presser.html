      Hotels, resorts, motels, caravan parks, backpacker hostels, bed and breakfast establishments, guesthouses, serviced and time-share apartments throughout Australia are joining forces with the Fair Work Ombudsman to improve compliance with federal workplace laws across the accommodation sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Accommodation Association of Australia (AAoA) has signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of its members aimed at creating and maintaining fair workplaces and a level playing field for employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      It follows similar MoUs the Fair Work Ombudsman has signed recently with the Australian Hotels Association, Restaurant and Catering Association and the Australian Security Industry Association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell, who co-signed the MoU with AAoA chief executive officer Richard Munro, has welcomed the association’s commitment to collaboration and exchange of information, saying it is pleasing to see the two parties work together to promote and achieve workplace compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will provide advice to the AAoA about how it can assist its members to meet their workplace obligations as employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The AAoA has agreed to apprise the Fair Work Ombudsman of any problems faced by the industry that can act as barriers to compliance. The two parties will work together to devise appropriate solutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This agreement highlights AAoA’s commitment to making compliance with workplace laws a high priority across the accommodation sector,” Mr Campbell said. “Through this initiative, the AAoA is acknowledging there are always opportunities for improvement and is actively seeking out those opportunities for its members.”
     </p>
     <p>
      AAoA Chief Executive Officer Richard Munro says signing the MoU is a “significant act” for the Association on behalf of its national membership. “The Association is proud of this agreed MoU, which we believe is part of our ongoing commitment to continue to support and improve the accommodation industry,” Mr Munro said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The framework around this MoU will work to improve compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws and enable accommodation companies to run business in a more collaborative and easy manner through access to employment information and the assurance of a level playing field across the industry.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s website – www.fairwork.gov.au – has information to assist employers as well as tools and resources for those who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
