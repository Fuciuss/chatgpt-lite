      How the leave accrues
     </h2>
     <p>
      An employee’s paid leave entitlement is available in full immediately and resets on their work anniversary. It doesn’t accumulate from year to year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paid family and domestic violence leave is a standalone leave entitlement. This means employees get it separately from other types of leave, such as annual leave or paid sick and carer’s leave.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h3>
       Example: Accessing paid leave for employees
      </h3>
      <p>
       Amy is a full-time employee who started working for a cleaning business on 1 March.
      </p>
      <p>
       From 1 March, Amy is entitled to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave
      </p>
      <p>
       In June, Amy uses 2 days of paid leave to deal with the impact of family and domestic violence by accessing police services and attending counselling. Her leave balance reduces to 8 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amy’s entitlement to paid family and domestic violence leave renews to 10 days on 1 March in the following year. This is the anniversary of her start date with her employer.

     <h2>
      <a id="agreements" name="agreements">
      </a>
      Registered and enterprise agreements
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employers and employees should check any agreement that applies to them, to see if it provides any additional entitlements or conditions for dealing with family and domestic violence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eligible employees get 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave even if their agreement provides less. This is because the NES always applies as the minimum entitlement, even if an award or agreement provides less.
     </p>
     <p>
      Types of agreements include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       registered agreements
      </li>
      <li>
       enterprise awards, or
      </li>
      <li>
       state reference public sector awards.

      Workplace policies
     </h2>
     <p>
      Some businesses may provide paid family and domestic violence leave entitlements in their employment contracts or workplace policies.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employment contract or workplace policy has less than the minimum entitlement in the NES, the NES entitlement applies. This means eligible employees get 10 days paid leave to deal with family and domestic violence, even if a contract gives less.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h3>
       Example: Workplace policies about family and domestic violence leave
      </h3>
      <p>
       Jo is entitled to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave each year under the NES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jo’s employer also has a family and domestic violence leave policy that provides all employees with an entitlement to 2 days of paid family and domestic violence leave each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jo’s entitlement under the NES is more generous than their employer’s policy. This means Jo is entitled to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave each year.
