     <p>
      Sick and carer’s leave is paid at an employee’s base pay rate for each hour or part of an hour of leave they take.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee who takes paid sick or carer’s leave is paid for the hours they would normally work during the period they took leave (not including overtime hours).
     </p>
     <p>
      A base pay rate doesn't include separate entitlements such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       incentive-based payments
      </li>
      <li>
       bonuses
      </li>
      <li>
       loadings
      </li>
      <li>
       allowances
      </li>
      <li>
       overtime
      </li>
      <li>
       penalty rates.
      </li>
     </ul>

       Example: Paid sick and carer’s leave on ordinary hours
      </h4>
      <p>
       Steve works 9am-5pm Monday to Friday every week. For the last 6 months he has been working overtime on Wednesday nights until 7pm. Steve is sick and takes a day of sick leave on a Wednesday. Steve is entitled to be paid sick leave for his normal hours of 9am-5pm, not the overtime hours.

     <p>
      Employees have to give notice to get paid for sick and carer’s leave. An employer can ask an employee to give evidence that shows the employee took the leave because they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       weren’t able to work because of an illness or injury, or
      </li>
      <li>
       needed to provide care or support to an immediate family or household member (because of an illness, injury, or unexpected emergency affecting the member).
