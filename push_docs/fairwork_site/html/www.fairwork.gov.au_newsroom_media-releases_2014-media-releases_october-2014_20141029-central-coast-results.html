      Fourteen businesses at
      <strong>
       Bateau Bay
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Lake Haven
      </strong>
      on the
      <strong>
       NSW Central Coast
      </strong>
      have reimbursed 62 of their staff a total of $42,000 after auditing by the Fair Work Ombudsman found the employees were being underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The businesses were among 22 independently-owned and operated businesses in the areas randomly audited by Fair Work inspectors late last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than half of the underpayments occurred at one
      <strong>
       Bateau Bay
      </strong>
      business, which had short-changed eight workers, including a number from non-English speaking backgrounds, almost $23,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors also found that a further six businesses had contravened record-keeping and pay slip laws. Only two of the 22 businesses were fully compliant with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the businesses which had underpaid their employees co-operated with inspectors and rectified all outstanding entitlements without the need for further enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We have a flexible and fair approach to inadvertent mistakes and employers who are willing to co-operate with us to ensure they don’t occur in the future,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Infringement Notices totalling $5100 were issued against one employer who had been cautioned previously about failing to keep accurate records and issue pay slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      The audits were prompted by persistent requests for assistance from Central Coast workers about their workplace rights being compromised.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors also provided employers with information and advice about how the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist them to understand and comply with their workplace obligations.

      The
      <a href="/home/home">
       Fair Work Ombudsman website

      - www.fairwork.gov.au - contains a range of tools and resources, including PayCheck Plus and an Award Finder, to assist business owners and employees determine the correct award and minimum wages for their industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Agency is committed to assisting small businesses, who represent the majority of Australian employers, understand and meet their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them and developing tools and resources to make their compliance obligations easier,” she said.
