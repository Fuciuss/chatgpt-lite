       to be consumed away from the point of sale
      </li>
      <li>
       packaged in a way that customers can choose to take them somewhere else to consume
      </li>
      <li>
       sold in food courts, shopping centres and retail complexes
      </li>
      <li>
       prepared and sold by the business and delivered by a third party.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Examples of employees covered by the Fast Food Award include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employees taking orders (including via an app), cooking and selling fast food
      </li>
      <li>
       baristas (in fast food shops or take-away cafes)
      </li>
      <li>
       delivery drivers
      </li>
      <li>
       supervisors of these employees
      </li>
      <li>
       employees in charge of a fast food / take-away shop or outlet
      </li>
      <li>
       cafes where the main food or drink is sold (and packaged) for take-away.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Fast Food Award also covers labour hire businesses and their employees who are placed with an organisation in the fast food industry.
