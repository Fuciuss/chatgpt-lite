      The former operators of a regional Victorian restaurant have been fined almost $19,000 for failing to back-pay an underpaid overseas worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Victorian woman Megha Sood, has been fined $3542 and her company Anahata Naturals Pty Ltd a further $15,300.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties have been imposed by the Federal Circuit Court following legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sood is the former owner-operator of the Anahata Food for Life Indian restaurant at
      <strong>
       Ocean Grove
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action after Sood and her company failed to comply with a Compliance Notice in October, 2013 to back-pay $8707 in wages owed to an underpaid chef.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chef was a Sri Lankan national in Australia on a temporary resident visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has also ordered Anahata Naturals to back-pay the employee in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors unless they have a reasonable excuse, or make a Court application to challenge the Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made extensive efforts to resolve the matter before commencing legal action, but were unable to secure co-operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers who fail to co-operate and rectify underpayments can face a significant fine on top of a Court Order for back-payment,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Successful litigations such as this also benefit employers who are complying with workplace laws, because it helps them to compete on a level playing field.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist employers with accurate, reliable information and encouraged businesses to access the Agency’s free tools and resources.
