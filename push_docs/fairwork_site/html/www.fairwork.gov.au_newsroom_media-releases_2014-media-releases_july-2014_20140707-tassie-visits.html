      <strong>
       7 July 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will visit businesses in
      <strong>
       Stanley
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Smithton
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Wynyard
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Somerset
      </strong>
      (Tasmania) this week as part of a national campaign to remind employers of the importance of maintaining proper employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors have already visited employers in
      <strong>
       Burnie
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Devonport
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Ulverstone
      </strong>
      and handed out education packs with information about the free tools and resources available from the Fair Work Ombudsman to assist them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors continue to see employers failing to keep correct records or issuing pay slips that contain the required information and are now visiting up to 350 employers in most States.
     </p>
     <p>
      The face-to-face visits are aimed at educating employers about their responsibilities and how the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist them to comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inadequate records hamper the ability of Fair Work inspectors to determine if employees are being paid correctly if a dispute arises over wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the past, the Agency has taken legal action against some employers who did not keep proper records and who were suspected of underpaying their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, Fair Work inspectors have just concluded discussions with dozens of
      <strong>
       Tasmanian
      </strong>
      businesses where contraventions with workplace laws were identified in 2012-13.
     </p>
     <p>
      The follow-up phone calls were aimed at ensuring the businesses, which had previously been found to have underpaid staff or made mistakes with pay-slips and record-keeping, are now meeting their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A report on the findings of a second round of auditing will be made available later this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      From July 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014, the agency received 505 requests for assistance from Tasmanian employees and recovered almost $216,000 in underpaid wages and entitlements for 169 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tasmanians generated 8500 phone calls to the Fair Work Infoline and 100,000 visits to the Fair Work Ombudsman website during the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has offices in Hobart and Launceston.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
