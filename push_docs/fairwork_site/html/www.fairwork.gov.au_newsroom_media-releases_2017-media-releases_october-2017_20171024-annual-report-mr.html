      <strong>
       24 October 2017
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s annual report for the 2016/17 financial year has been tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament.
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual report shows that people are more interested than ever in knowing their workplace rights and obligations, with the Fair Work Ombudsman recording a 25 per cent increase in the number of new online My Account registrations compared to the previous financial year and visits to the website, www.fairwork.gov.au increasing by 7 per cent to a total of 16,328,246.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the 2016/17 financial year, the Fair Work Ombudsman resolved nearly 27,000 requests for assistance involving a workplace dispute, a 9 per cent increase on the 2015/16 financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s focus on early intervention by providing employees and employers with tailored education and dispute resolution services has seen the average time taken to resolve a request for assistance involving a workplace dispute reduce to 15 days, as compared with 19 days in 2015/16.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2016/2017 financial year also saw the agency better targeting its compliance activities to focus on businesses, brands and sectors of the labour-market where analysis and intelligence gathering activities indicate serious and systemic non-compliance may exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The increased sophistication of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s intelligence-led approach has contributed to a  12 per cent increase in the total number of enforcement tools used by the agency with a total of $30.6 million recovered for more than 17,000 employees.
