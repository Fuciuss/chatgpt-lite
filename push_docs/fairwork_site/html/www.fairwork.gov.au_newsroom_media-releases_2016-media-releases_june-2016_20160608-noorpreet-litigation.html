      <strong>
       8 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former operator of a roadhouse in
      <strong>
       regional NSW
      </strong>
      will face Court for allegedly withholding more than $11,000 in Government-funded parental leave payments it was required to pay to a visa-holder, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Kulpreet Singh, former operator and part-owner of the United Petroleum roadhouse at
      <strong>
       Marrangaroo
      </strong>
      , near Lithgow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court is Noorpreet Pty Ltd. Mr Singh is a director of the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee was working as a chef at the restaurant on a 487 skilled regional sponsored visa at the time she had a child. She is now an Australian citizen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Human Services (DHS) transferred $11,538 to Noorpreet in April, 2015 for the company to transfer to the employee following the birth of her child.
     </p>
     <p>
      She was entitled to the funds under the Commonwealth Government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the employee complained to DHS that her employer had not paid her the money, the matter was referred to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Singh allegedly made a false document purporting to show that he paid the parental leave funds in cash to the employee’s husband in May, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman challenged the veracity of the document.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Singh and Noorpreet transferred the money to the employee in October last year, more than five months after it was due.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers who contravene the law and deliberately mislead investigators can expect to face legal action.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the first time the Fair Work Ombudsman has taken legal action against an employer for failing to transfer Paid Parental Leave funds to an employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Singh and Noorpreet Pty Ltd face penalties of up to $10,200 and $51,000 respectively for one contravention of the Paid Parental Leave Act relating to the alleged failure to provide the parental leave funds to the employee within the required time frame.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, Mr Singh and Noorpreet Pty Ltd face penalties of up to $5100 and $25,500 per contravention for a number of alleged breaches of the Fair Work Act relating to records and pay- slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney for June 15.
