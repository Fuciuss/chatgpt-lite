       The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced a second litigation against the operator of a
       <strong>
        Melbourne
       </strong>
       burger bar for allegedly exploiting more young and overseas workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing the Federal Circuit Court is Todd Patrick Buzza, who owns and runs the Burger Buzz outlet on Sydney Road,
      <strong>
       Brunswick
      </strong>
      , and his company Rum Runner Trading Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action against Mr Buzza and his company last year in relation to $7113 allegedly owing to seven former employees - including two teenagers and four overseas workers on working holiday visas - who worked across the Brunswick outlet and Mr Buzza’s former Burger Buzz outlet in
      <strong>
       West Melbourne
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has now commenced a second legal action against Mr Buzza and his company, alleging they short-changed a further five employees who worked at the Brunswick outlet a total of $7513 between December, 2015 and July, 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two of the workers were aged just 19 and one was an overseas worker from France who was in Australia on a 417 working holiday visa at the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      As with the first legal action, the workers were allegedly underpaid for short periods of work ranging from two to six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that one of the workers was paid nothing for work performed, while the other four were paid only a fraction of their lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      This allegedly resulted in underpayment of the workers’ minimum hourly rates, late night allowances and penalty rates for weekend and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors investigated after workers lodged requests for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Mr Buzza and his company also contravened workplace laws by knowingly providing inspectors with false and misleading records and failing to comply with a Notice to Produce employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace laws relating to pay slips, frequency of pay and meal breaks were allegedly also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says it is of concern that Mr Buzza’s business has been the subject of a number of previous underpayment allegations from employees, and inspectors had formally advised him of minimum pay obligations on at least two occasions in 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also has ongoing investigations into further requests for assistance from workers who claim they were underpaid at the Burger Buzz outlet in Brunswick.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are concerned that the allegations made by a series of workers suggest a pattern of non-compliant behaviour and a business model based on the exploitation of vulnerable workers,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Buzza faces maximum penalties ranging from $3600 to $10,800 per contravention and Rum Runner Trading Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $18,000 to $54,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for Mr Buzza and his company to back-pay the employees in full and an injunction restraining Mr Buzza and his company from underpaying workers in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the injunction is granted, Mr Buzza and his company could face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayment contraventions that are proven in court.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on February 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says employers need to be aware that exploitation of vulnerable workers is serious conduct that will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We treat underpayment of young and overseas workers particularly seriously because they can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their entitlements or reluctant to complain,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the 2015-16 financial year, 38 of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s 50 litigations (76 per cent) involved a visa holder. Sixteen of those litigations involved a 417 visa holder.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2015-16, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered just over $3 million for all visa-holders, with $1.37 million of this for 417 visa-holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is also committed to improving compliance in the hospitality industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s three-year National Hospitality Industry Campaign, finalised last year, resulted in more than $1.2 million being recovered for underpaid employees at restaurants, cafés and catering companies throughout Australia.
