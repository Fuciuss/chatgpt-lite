      <strong>
       17 September 2014
      </strong>

     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors are this week doorknocking therapeutic massage centres and nail salons in
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      to ensure employees are receiving their correct wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Up to 20 businesses have been earmarked for random auditing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will be assessing compliance with minimum hourly rates, penalty rates and allowances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance with pay-slip and record-keeping obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Detailed investigations will be undertaken if serious issues are identified.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses received education packs last week to assist employers to review their workplace practices ahead of auditing.
     </p>
     <p>
      They included a copy of the
      <em>
       Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2010
      </em>
      for therapeutic massage businesses and the
      <em>
       Hair and Beauty Industry Award 2010
      </em>
      for nail salons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pay guides and fact sheets on record-keeping and pay-slips were also distributed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is important that employers in Darwin understand their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says massage businesses and nail salons were selected for attention because they employ a significant number of overseas workers and employees for whom English is a second language.
     </p>
     <p>
      “These workers can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their workplace rights or are reluctant to complain, so it’s important we are proactive about ensuring they are being paid correctly,” Ms James said
     </p>
     <p>
      Where inspectors identify errors, they will work with employers to assist them to rectify mistakes and put processes in place to ensure they are not repeated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will then make follow-up inquiries later to ensure employers have followed through on commitments to address any non-compliance issues.
