      Why workplace problems happen
     </h2>
     <p>
      Problems can happen when employers and employees don’t follow the correct workplace laws and rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees can accidentally break workplace laws when they don't know or understand their workplace rights and obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      These types of problems can often be resolved quickly when employees and employers communicate and work together to find a solution.

      Try talking to your employer or employee first
     </h2>
     <p>
      If you’re having a problem at work, we recommend that you raise it with your employee or employer first. When employees and employers communicate and work together to come up with their own solutions, the problem can usually be resolved without our help.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even where an employee has left their employment, we encourage employers and employees to raise issues directly before asking for our help.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can use our tools and resources to help you get things back on track.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some workplace problems that we know happen regularly. We have step-by-step guides for addressing these

       Example: Phone enquiry
      </h3>
      <p>
       Damian is a casual store person in a warehouse and regularly works on weekends. He’s been employed for 6 months and has never been paid weekend penalty rates, which he’s heard he’s entitled to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damian contacts us to check his entitlements and get advice about what to do next.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spoke to an adviser who asked him about his workplace, his job and his situation. Our adviser referred Damian to the Storage Services and Wholesale Award and explained the relevant weekend penalties in the award to him. Our adviser also walked Damian through how to obtain this information using our Pay Calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The adviser suggested that Damian approach his employer to discuss the underpayment and provided Damian with resources to help him prepare for the conversation, including links to:

      Step 2: Communicate
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you've checked the law and still think there is a problem, the next step is to have a conversation with your employer or employee.

     <h4>
      Talk about it
     </h4>
     <p>
      Practical steps you can take to make difficult workplace conversations easier and more effective include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Make time to talk to your employer or employee without interruptions.
      </li>
      <li>
       Be prepared:
       <ul>
        <li>
         know the issues you want to discuss
        </li>
        <li>
         bring along any relevant paperwork, for example pay slips or bank statements
        </li>
        <li>
         have some some suggestions for how the issue could be fixed.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       Listen, keep an open mind and consider all points of view.
      </li>
      <li>
       Let your employer or employee know that you’ve checked the relevant entitlements or obligations with us, using our website or over the phone.
      </li>
      <li>
       Check our website for information together so you can read and talk about the same information.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h4>
      Put it in writing
     </h4>
     <p>
      When you’ve agreed on next steps or outcomes, it helps to put it in writing so everyone is clear on what you agreed on and what will happen next. For example, you could send a follow up email to your employer or employee with a summary of what you talked about and agreed to.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you haven’t been able to agree on next steps, it can help to put your concerns in writing. This is a good way to clearly identify the issues that haven’t been resolved and what type of response you want.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you put something in writing that needs an answer, make sure you give the other person enough time to respond. Remember to be polite and courteous. Most problems at work happen because of a misunderstanding.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Step 3: Take further action
     </h3>
     <p>
      If you haven’t been able to fix the issue by raising it with your employee or employer, you may want to take further action. The action you choose to take will depend on the issue you’re trying to fix and the type of help you want.
