      What part-time employees get
     </h2>
     <p>
      Part-time employees get the same minimum entitlements as a full-time employee, but on a pro-rata basis. This includes paid leave, such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       annual leave
      </li>
      <li>
       sick and carer’s leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      They also get 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave. This isn't pro-rated.
     </p>

       Example: Sick and carer's leave entitlements for part­-time employees
      </h3>
      <p>
       Suzanne is a full-time employee who works 38 hours, 5 days a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rebecca is a part-time employee who works an average of 19 hours per week, working a 5-day fortnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suzanne gets 76 hours (or 10 days) of paid sick and carer's leave per year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rebecca gets half of Suzanne’s paid sick and carer's leave per year as she works half the hours Suzanne works.

      How part-time is different to full-time or casual employment
     </h2>
     <p>
      Full-time employees work longer hours. On average, they work 38 hours per week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Casual employees usually work irregular hours. A casual employee does not have a firm commitment in advance from their employer to ongoing work with an agreed pattern of work.
