      <strong>
       30 April 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An Australian fishing company is to face legal action for allegedly underpaying four of its Indonesian crew tens of thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three deckhands and an engineer were allegedly underpaid a total of $77,390 between July, 2012 and June, 2013, according to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The male employees worked on the
      <em>
       Santo Rocco
      </em>
      , which primarily docked in NSW, and the
      <em>
       Challenge
      </em>
      , which primarily docked in Queensland.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the 457 visa-holders were underpaid amounts ranging from $14,705 to $24,494.
     </p>
     <p>
      It has commenced legal proceedings against the fishing company - Australian Wild Tuna Pty Ltd - in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court is company director and manager Angelo Maiorana, of Sydney.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman says the Indonesian crew were allegedly underpaid their wages while working in waters off the east coast.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is seeking civil penalties against Australian Wild Tuna Pty Ltd and Mr Maiorana, alleging multiple breaches of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contraventions relating to pay slips, record-keeping and frequency-of-pay are also being alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made extensive efforts to resolve the matter before legal proceedings were commenced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the employer's failure to rectify such a large alleged underpayment of vulnerable overseas workers is a significant factor in the decision to litigate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has established an Overseas Workers' Team responsible for conducting Visa monitoring activities, as well as undertaking high-profile complaint investigations and proactive compliance activities relating to the employment of overseas workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Maiorana faces maximum penalties up to $10,200 per breach and the company up to $51,000 per contravention.
