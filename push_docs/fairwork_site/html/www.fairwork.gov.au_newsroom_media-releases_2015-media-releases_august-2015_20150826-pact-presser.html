      The Fair Work Ombudsman now has a mobile-friendly pay tool to give employers and employees access to reliable advice on wages and entitlements on-the-go.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) combines pay, shift and leave calculators with an intuitive interface for mobile devices.
     </p>
     <p>
      It can locate the correct Modern Award for an employee’s position and quickly determine what wages apply, including any overtime, penalty rates or allowances payable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Users who go to
      <a href="http://www.calculate.fairwork.gov.au">
       www.calculate.fairwork.gov.au
      </a>
      can work out wages per hour, per shift or for an entire pay period.
     </p>
     <p>
      PACT can also determine the entitlements payable when employees resign or are terminated, including wages in lieu of notice, leave and redundancy pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is linked to another online tool, My Account, which enables employers and employees to save the advice they receive and review it at any time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information and advice can also be sent to a customer’s My Account if they submit an inquiry to the Fair Work Ombudsman or call the Fair Work Infoline for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman website has become a valuable source of information and advice on workplace relations, with more than 13.4 million visits last financial year, up from 11 million in 2013-14.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website had more than 2.2 million visits to its various pay tools in 2014-15, an increase of 40 per cent over the 1.5 million hits the previous year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since going live for testing in May, PACT has already proven very popular with more than 584,000 users who have registered almost one million sessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is now quicker and easier for small business owners and employees to get the information they need, when they need it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says many businesses don’t operate from an office and PACT enables them to determine pay rates without accessing a computer or tying up their phone line.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This preference for going online is allowing our Infoline to focus on more complex telephone inquiries and to prioritise calls from small business,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website also has an interactive Online Learning Centre covering topics such as difficult conversations in the workplace, starting a new job, managing performance and hiring employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      A dedicated webpage for small business can be found at www.fairwork.gov.au/smallbusiness
      <strong>
      </strong>
      or businesses can call
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      and opt to be put through to a helpline to receive priority service.
