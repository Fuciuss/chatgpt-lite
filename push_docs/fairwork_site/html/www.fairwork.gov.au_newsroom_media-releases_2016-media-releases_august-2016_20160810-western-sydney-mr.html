      <strong>
       10 August 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Two international students working at a fast-food outlet in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      have been short-changed thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments were discovered during a random audit of the business by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The visa-holders, from India, were paid flat rates of $18 an hour for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fast Food Industry Award
      </em>
      , they should have been paid $23.74 for ordinary hours, $28.49 on Saturdays, $33.24 on Sundays and $52.23 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were underpaid $3820 and $3345 respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <strong>
       Harris Park
      </strong>
      business also failed to issue pay-slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      It has received a formal Letter of Caution placing it on notice that further breaches of workplace laws may result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers need to take the time to understand the wage rates applicable to their individual workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have minimum pay rates in Australia, they apply to everyone, and they are not negotiable," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "While most employers want to do the right thing, there are some who seek to gain a competitive advantage by exploiting vulnerable workers, such as visa-holders."
     </p>
     <p>
      In separate matters in Sydney’s west, the Fair Work Ombudsman has also recovered:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $11,800 for 20 employees at a
       <strong>
        Wetherill Park
       </strong>
       logistics company who did not receive their correct casual base rate because the employer failed to revise wages following the annual wage increase,
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $5100 for a female part-time teacher in
       <strong>
        North Parramatta
       </strong>
       who did not receive payment while on sick leave for two months because the employer misinterpreted the enterprise agreement,
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $6800 for two part-time hairdressers, a full-time apprentice hairdresser and a part-time beautician in
       <strong>
        Parramatta
       </strong>
       who were paid flat rates instead of the higher Award hourly minimum and Saturday penalty rate, and
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        $6000 for a pest control technician in
        <strong>
         Seven Hills
        </strong>
        who did not receive his annual leave entitlements upon leaving the business.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is important that businesses, particularly small businesses, know that they can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for advice and assistance if they are unsure of their obligations.
     </p>
