      Everyone has the right to a workplace free from bullying.

     <ul>
      <li>
       a person or group of people repeatedly behave unreasonably towards another worker or group of workers
      </li>
      <li>

      What is bullying?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Bullying happens at work when:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a person or group of people repeatedly behave unreasonably towards another worker or group of workers
      </li>
      <li>
       the behaviour creates a risk to health and safety.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Examples of bullying include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       behaving aggressively towards others
      </li>
      <li>
       teasing or playing practical jokes
      </li>
      <li>
       pressuring someone to behave inappropriately
      </li>
      <li>
       excluding someone from work-related events
      </li>
      <li>
       unreasonable work demands.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Sexual harassment in the workplace
     </h3>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, sexual harassment at work happens when a worker or group of workers:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       makes an unwelcome sexual advance
      </li>
      <li>
       makes an unwelcome request for sexual favours
      </li>
      <li>
       engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to another worker.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      To be sexual harassment, it has to be reasonable to expect that there is a possibility that the worker being sexually harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some forms of sexual harassment can also be considered bullying if the behaviour is repeated or continuous. But unlike bullying, sexual harassment does not need to be continuous or repeated behaviour, it can be a one-off event. There is also no need to establish a risk to health and safety.

     <h3>
      Discrimination in the workplace
     </h3>
     <p>
      Bullying is different from discrimination. The Fair Work Act prohibits an employer from taking adverse action against an employee for discriminatory reasons, including their sex, race, religion or gender. Adverse action can include firing or demoting someone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bullying doesn't have to be related to a person’s or group's characteristics. Adverse action doesn’t have to have happened for bullying to occur.
     </p>

      Reasonable management action
     </h2>
     <p>
      Reasonable management action that's carried out in a reasonable way is not bullying.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer or manager can:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       make decisions about poor performance
      </li>
      <li>
       take disciplinary action
      </li>
      <li>
       direct and control the way work is carried out.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Management action that isn't carried out in a reasonable way may be considered bullying.

     <p>
      The laws to stop bullying under the Fair Work Act only apply to certain workers in Australia. A worker includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an employee
      </li>
      <li>
       a contractor or subcontractor
      </li>
      <li>
       an outworker
      </li>
      <li>
       an apprentice or a trainee
      </li>
      <li>
       an intern
      </li>
      <li>
       a student gaining work experience
      </li>
      <li>
       some volunteers.
      </li>
     </ul>

      The Fair Work Commission (FWC) is the national workplace relations tribunal that deals with applications to stop bullying at work under the Fair Work Act.
