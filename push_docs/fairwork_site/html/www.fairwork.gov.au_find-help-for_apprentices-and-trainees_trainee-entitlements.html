      Most trainees get their conditions and entitlements from Schedule E in the Miscellaneous Award. Other entitlements like payment for time spent at training may depend on the

      Some awards set out rules and entitlements for training contracts and payment for training fees. If the award doesn’t cover this, it will depend on what was agreed to by the employer and the employee in the training contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some awards say that employers are required to pay for training fees charged by the trainee’s Registered Training Organisation. They can include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       course fees
      </li>
      <li>
       the cost of course required textbooks
      </li>
      <li>
       the cost of assessment materials.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      There are some exceptions to this. To understand more about your training costs and fees, see our
