     <p>
      There should never be a situation where a worker is owed more each week than they actually receive in their hand.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is a slap in the face for that long-standing notion of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moreover, it is blatantly unlawful.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unfortunately, though, it does happen, for reasons ranging from innocent mistakes to deliberate exploitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Disturbingly, it has happened when big business either turns a blind eye to, or is willing to hide behind, complex supply chains and sub-contracting arrangements which rely on exploitation of vulnerable workers to make a profit.
     </p>
     <p>
      When we investigated significant underpayment of a group of Adelaide trolley collectors in 2010, it became clear new strategies were needed to ensure real change in the recidivist, non-compliant trolley collecting industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      In just 18 months, 10 vulnerable employees collecting trolleys at Coles supermarket sites across Adelaide were short-changed $220,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      For years, the Fair Work Ombudsman has been chasing unscrupulous contractors in this industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was time big business stopped wiping its hands of the problem with the excuse that it was not the employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      We were not going to build a culture of compliance by merely picking off fly-by-night contractors who quickly liquidated – they are just replaced by new entities which behave in the same manner and are often run by the same people.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was time to tie all the players in the supply chain to the problem to find a sustainable solution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The industry employed young, often migrant workers, in the low-skilled but physically demanding and often dangerous role.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most trolley collectors were employed by sub-contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      They worked on the end of a long, usually complex, chain of deals where responsibility for compliance with workplace rules increasingly evaporated the further up the chain you look.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Adelaide case, Coles Supermarkets Australia had typically used the supply chain arrangements as an “out” clause for its requirement to comply with the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      – often stating it wasn’t the direct employer, so the collectors were not its responsibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was that kind of attitude that created the shocking circumstances where a young Adelaide western suburbs trolley collector could be short-changed almost $90,000 in 18 months for his work in this back-breaking job.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Indian migrant did not receive 65 per cent of his total wages, while one of his offsiders did not receive almost 79 per cent of his wages’ entitlement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Six years on and the Fair Work Ombudsman has now completed its strongest play in the fight for fairness in the sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our first breakthrough came in October 2014 when, as a result of proceedings against bottom- of-the-chain trolley collector employers Ahmad Al Hilfi and Ayam Al Basry over the $220,000 underpayment, Coles stepped up to publicly admit that it had an “ethical and moral responsibility” for the conduct of all persons in its business.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the Federal Court made declarations against the third-tier trolley collection service providers, we successfully obtained enforcement outcomes against the top and bottom links in a supply chain where exploitation of vulnerable workers was rampant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last week, we got the trifecta.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strike three was delivered in the Federal Court against the troublesome supply chain with the middlemen – the operators of Sydney-based and now in liquidation Starlink and Starlink Operations Nidal Albarouki and Clency Ferriere - ordered to pay $94,050 each for allowing the gross non-compliance in their Adelaide operations to continue unabated.
     </p>
     <p>
      All levels in the supply chain have now been penalised or had an enforcement outcome applied against it and a first-year report by Coles on how it is meeting its Enforceable Undertaking with us shows strong improvement in compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coles is now in-sourcing its trolley collectors and deserves credit for cleaning up its act and working with the Fair Work Ombudsman to put a stop to the non-compliance in the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, last week’s penalty sends a clear message to other sectors operating with supply chain and sub-contractor arrangements that they can expect to be held accountable if any part of their labour networks contravene workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have, and will always, vigorously pursue the direct employer when we find cases of non-compliance. It is the employer first and foremost who is responsible for paying the correct entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      But the community expects more from established and profitable brands. And the law can extend legal responsibility up the supply chain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Operations which use supply chain and sub-contractor arrangements are on notice, especially in the area of trolley collection and industries where employees are traditionally low paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are not finished with the trolley collection sector, and if major supermarkets are not already having a boardroom discussion about the governance of their trolley collection services, then someone is asleep at the wheel.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will also examine the extent to which other businesses are involved and should also be held responsible.
     </p>
     <p>
      If we find a business underpaying workers and that business is part of a franchise or supply chain, we will look up to the business at the top, the franchisor, principal or purchaser; because they are the price-makers and they control the settings.
