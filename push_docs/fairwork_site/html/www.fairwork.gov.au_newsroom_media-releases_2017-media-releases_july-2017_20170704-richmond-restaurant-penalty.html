      A Fair Work Ombudsman legal action has secured a penalty against the former operator of an Indian restaurant in suburban Melbourne for failing to back-pay two underpaid Indian workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A $500 penalty has been imposed in the Federal Circuit Court against Hari Pal, who formerly owned and operated Konna Indian Cuisine, later renamed Punjabi Tandoori Corner, in
      <strong>
       Richmond
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman found that two Indian visa-holders, both females studying in Melbourne, were short-changed a total of $8082 for waitressing work they performed at the restaurant between October, 2014 and January 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were paid a flat rate of $12 an hour and did not receive penalty rates when working on weekends, nights and public holidays. They were individually short-changed $5395 and $2687.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pal was not the owner of the restaurant at the time of the underpayments but he was the owner in October, 2015 when the Fair Work Ombudsman issued the restaurant a Compliance Notice requiring the underpayment to be rectified.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action when the Notice was not complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      , business operators must adhere to a Compliance Notice or make a Court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pal has now personally rectified more than half of the underpayment of the workers and has undertaken to rectify the rest by way of monthly instalments.
