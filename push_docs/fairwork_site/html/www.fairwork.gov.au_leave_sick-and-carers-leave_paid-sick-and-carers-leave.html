      An employee can take paid sick leave when they can't work because of a personal illness or injury. This can include stress and pregnancy related illnesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee can take paid carer's leave to care for or support a member of their immediate family or household who is:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       sick
      </li>
      <li>
       injured, or

      <li>
       has an unexpected emergency.

      All employees (except casual employees) are entitled to paid sick and carer's leave. This entitlement comes from the

       National Employment Standards (NES)
      </a>
      .
     </p>

      How much leave an employee gets
     </h2>
     <p>
      Paid sick and carer's leave comes under the same leave entitlement. It's also known as personal / carer's leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      The yearly entitlement is based on an employee’s ordinary hours of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The leave is 10 days for full-time employees, and pro-rata for part-time employees. This can be calculated as 1/26 of an employee’s ordinary hours of work in a year.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h4>
       Example: Sick and carer's leave entitlements for part­-time employees
      </h4>
      <p>
       Suzanne is a full-time employee who works 38 hours, 5 days a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rebecca is a part-time employee who works an average of 19 hours per week, working a 5-day fortnight. Suzanne gets 76 hours of paid sick and carer's leave per year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rebecca gets half of Suzanne’s paid sick and carer's leave (38 hours) per year as she works half the hours Suzanne works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of paid sick and carer’s leave accumulated over a period isn’t affected by differences in the spread of an employee’s ordinary hours of work in a week.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h4>
       Example: Different spread of hours
      </h4>
      <p>
       If Suzanne works 38 ordinary hours a week over five days (Monday to Friday), and Jango works 38 ordinary hours over four days per week, they both accumulate the same amount of sick and carer’s leave. Over a year of employment, both employees accumulate 76 hours of paid sick and carer’s leave.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      A registered agreement, award or contract can set out different entitlements to paid sick and carer's leave, but they can't be less than the minimum in the NES.

      How the leave accumulates
     </h2>
     <p>
      Full-time and part-time employees accumulate sick and carer's leave during each year of employment. It starts accumulating from an employee's first day of work and is based on their ordinary hours of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The balance at the end of each year carries over to the next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sick and carer's leave accumulates when an employee is on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       paid leave, such as:
       <ul>
        <li>
         paid annual leave
        </li>
        <li>
         paid sick and carer's leave
        </li>
        <li>
         paid family and domestic violence leave
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       community service leave including jury duty
      </li>
      <li>
       long service leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Sick and carer's leave doesn’t accumulate when the employee is on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       unpaid annual leave
      </li>
      <li>
       unpaid sick or carer's leave
      </li>
      <li>
       unpaid parental leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
