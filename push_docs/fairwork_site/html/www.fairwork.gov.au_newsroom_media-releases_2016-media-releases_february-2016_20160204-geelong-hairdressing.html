      </strong>
      hair salon paid an adult apprentice hairdresser less than $7 an hour, inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 29-year-old female employee was short-changed a total of $17,400 between August, 2014 and September, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      For most of her employment, the employee was paid an hourly rate of just $6.67 on weekdays and $8.83 on Saturdays.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, as a first-year adult apprentice she was entitled to $11.75 on weekdays and $20.89 on Saturdays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employee told inspectors the low wage caused her to struggle financially.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Before contacting our office for assistance, she asked her employer to increase her pay rates, but was rebuffed," Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      When contacted by Fair Work inspectors, the business said it could not afford to pay the entitlements under the
      <em>
       Hair and Beauty Industry Award
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the salon was informed the minimum Award rate was not optional, and is now repaying all outstanding entitlements on a plan agreed to by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that because the businesses co-operated, agreed to repay all money owed and ensure ongoing compliance with its obligations, it has avoided further enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      She reminded Geelong employers of the importance of ensuring that they understand the wage rates applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee has since resigned to continue her apprenticeship elsewhere.
