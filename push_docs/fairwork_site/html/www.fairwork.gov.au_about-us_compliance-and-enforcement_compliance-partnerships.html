      What are compliance partnerships
     </h2>
     <p>
      A Compliance Partnership is a collaborative relationship between us and businesses that want to publicly demonstrate their commitment to creating compliant and productive workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      We work with businesses who value their reputation and want to keep a positive relationship with their employees, their customers and the Australian community. Through a Compliance Partnership with us, businesses can ensure their systems and processes are working effectively to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>

      How do they work?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Compliance Partnerships are formalised through Proactive Compliance Deeds (PCD) which are tailored to the business. PCDs are documents, signed by both us and the business, that outline the steps the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) and the business will take to make sure they're compliant with workplace laws. They usually continue for a 2-3 year period and offer:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       better communication between the employer and its employee through better systems for dealing with workplace issues
      </li>
      <li>
       streamlined and cooperative relationships between us and the employer
      </li>
      <li>
       public demonstration of an employers commitment to:
       <ul>
        <li>
         being an employer of choice
        </li>
        <li>
         ethical and lawful corporate behaviour.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In Compliance Partnerships, the business and FWO agree to work together to make sure its employees receive the correct pay and entitlements. This might include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       resolving workplace issues directly with its employees
      </li>
      <li>
       self-auditing of pay and record-keeping
      </li>
      <li>
       reviewing and monitoring supply chain and franchise relationships
      </li>
      <li>
       providing appropriate workplace relations training for key staff
      </li>
      <li>
       resolving technical workplace issues as they arise.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We usually publish PCDs on our website. Read more examples from our published list of
