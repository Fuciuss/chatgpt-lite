      <strong>
       31 August 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against a 7-Eleven retail store in Sydney which allegedly underpaid two migrant employees almost $50,000 and created erroneous records for the workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing the Federal Circuit Court is Harmandeep Singh Sarkaria, who owns and operates the 7-Eleven  outlet at 354 Flushcombe Road in
      <strong>
       Blacktown
      </strong>
      . Also facing court is Mr Sarkaria’s company, Amritsaria Four Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Sarkaria and his company allegedly underpaid two console operators a total of $49,426.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the alleged underpayment relates to a migrant employee from Pakistan aged in his late 30s, allegedly short-changed a total of $43,633 between March, 2012 and March, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other employee, also from Pakistan and aged in his mid-20s, was on an international student visa when he started working at the store. Now a permanent resident of Australia, he was also allegedly underpaid $5793 between August, 2013 and March, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman claims the alleged underpayments are the result of the workers often being paid rates equivalent to $10 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were entitled to receive normal hourly rates of more $22 an hour and up to $29.27 an hour for some weekend, public holiday and overtime shifts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amritsaria Four Pty Ltd allegedly made erroneous entries into the 7-Eleven head office payroll system that significantly understated the hours the employees had worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also allegedly routinely made entries that the employees had worked only 10 hours a week, despite them working significantly more hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman claims the erroneous entries gave the appearance that the employees were paid about $25 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigating the underpayments were allegedly provided with false time-and-wages sheets that understated the hours the employees had worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence legal action because of the seriousness of the alleged breaches and the involvement of vulnerable migrant employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Sarkaria faces maximum penalties of between $5100 and $10,200 per breach and his company $25,500 to $51,000 per breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      He has been co-operating with the Fair Work Ombudsman in relation to rectifying the alleged underpayments.
