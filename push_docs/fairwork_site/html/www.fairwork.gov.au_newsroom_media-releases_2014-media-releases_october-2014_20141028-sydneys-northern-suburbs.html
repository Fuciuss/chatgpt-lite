      <strong>
       28 October 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Workers in Sydney’s Northern and North-Western suburbs have been back-paid more than $47,000 after recent inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      In
      <strong>
       Mosman
      </strong>
      , a real estate agent who sold a million-dollar property was back-paid $15,200 after her employer failed to pay commission on the sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agent was employed on a commission-only basis and approached the Fair Work Ombudsman after it was not paid on termination of her employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers must ensure they pay employees their full, lawful entitlements when an employment relationship ends.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Paying workers correctly upon termination of employment is just as important as ensuring they receive their correct wages and conditions throughout their employment,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $7800 for two employees at a
       <strong>
        Carlingford
       </strong>
       business not paid for all hours worked during a three-month period last year,
      </li>
      <li>
       $6300 for a help-desk operator at a
       <strong>
        Thornleigh
       </strong>
       IT firm not paid outstanding wages and annual leave entitlements upon termination of employment last year,
      </li>
      <li>
       $6200 for a florist in
       <strong>
        North Sydney
       </strong>
       underpaid her minimum hourly rate and casual loading entitlements over a 12-month period,
      </li>
      <li>
       $5900 for a shop assistant at a
       <strong>
        Pymble
       </strong>
       retail business not paid for all hours worked during various periods in 2012-2013, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5900 for a young labourer at
       <strong>
        Stanhope Gardens
       </strong>
       underpaid his minimum hourly rate and annual leave entitlements on termination of employment last year.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says that after Fair Work inspectors contacted the businesses and explained their obligations, the employees were reimbursed all money owed.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and helping them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says businesses looking for information should consult the range of tools and resources available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
