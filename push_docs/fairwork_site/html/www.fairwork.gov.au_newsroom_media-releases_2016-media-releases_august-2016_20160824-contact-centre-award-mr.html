       The Fair Work Ombudsman has again been recognised for the exceptional customer service provided by its Fair Work Infoline.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Agency has won the coveted award for “Best Government Contact Centre with Over 30 Staff” at the Government Contact Centre Excellence Awards 2016.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is the second time the Fair Work Infoline has received the top honour, taking out the award in 2014.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Infoline has also finished as a finalist on several occasions.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says she is extremely proud of the high quality of services delivered by Fair Work Infoline Advisers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our Advisers are experts in their field and play such a valuable role in educating the Australian community about their rights and obligations under workplace laws,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “The judges were particularly impressed with the Fair Work Infoline’s management of customer demand and improvement of customer experience.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Infoline implemented several new measures in 2014-15, including an “in-queue call back” service to improve the experience for callers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This helped to achieve average wait times of six minutes on what are normally the Infoline’s busiest days of the year.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Recent innovations also contributed to 39,000 additional customers using the Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) to calculate their wages during July, an 11 percent increase.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       July is typically the busiest time for the Agency’s frontline teams following the implementation of the annual National Minimum Wage rise.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Infoline Advisers use PACT when calculating wages for callers.  PACT provides answers to the vast majority of Infoline enquiries and can be used by everyone.  Visit
