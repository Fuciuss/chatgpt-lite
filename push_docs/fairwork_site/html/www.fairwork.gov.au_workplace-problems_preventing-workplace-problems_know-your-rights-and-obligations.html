     <p>
      Employers need to know their rights and obligations in their workplace. This includes knowing the correct award that applies to their employees and relevant minimum pay rates, including penalty rates and overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most problems in the workplace happen when there is lack of awareness about workplace entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Being informed helps to maintain a harmonious work environment with more engaged and productive employees. Getting pay and entitlements right also means employers can avoid serious penalties.

      Knowing your rights and obligations is one of the most important things you can do to prevent workplace problems. If you know what you’re entitled to, you can recognise and raise issues with your employer before they become a problem. The resources on this page will help you become better informed.

      Minimum pay rates

     <p>
      Minimum pay rates are set out in awards. An employer can choose to pay an employee more than the award rate but can’t pay less.

     <p>
      You can use our

      to work out wages under the awards, including penalty rates, overtime, and allowances.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer may also choose to pay an employee an annualised salary. This has to still cover all minimum requirements provided by the relevant award.
     </p>
     <p>
      All awards and registered agreements include an individual flexibility arrangement (IFA) clause that allow an employer and current employee to agree to change certain provisions of their award or registered agreement.
