      Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employers who engage employees under relevant Commonwealth workplace laws are required to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       make and keep accurate and complete records for all of their employees (for example, time worked and wages paid)
      </li>
      <li>
       issue pay slips to each employee.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These record-keeping and pay slip obligations are designed to ensure that employees receive their correct wages and entitlements.

      What are the record-keeping obligations?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employee records must:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       be in a form that is readily accessible to a Fair Work Inspector
      </li>
      <li>
       be in a legible form and in English (preferably in plain, simple English)
      </li>
      <li>
       be kept for 7 years
      </li>
      <li>
       not be altered unless for the purposes of correcting an error
      </li>
      <li>
       not be false or misleading to the employer's knowledge.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employee records are private and confidential. Generally, no one can access them other than the employee, their employer, and relevant payroll staff. Employers must make copies of an employee’s records available at the request of an employee or former employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Fair Work Inspectors and organisation officials (such as a trade union) may access employee records (including personal information) to determine if there has been a contravention of relevant Commonwealth workplace laws.
     </p>

     </ul>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      If the transferring employee becomes an employee of the new employer after the transfer, the new employer must ask the old employer to provide them with the employee’s records. The old employer must give the records to the new employer.
     </p>
     <p>

     </h2>
     <p>
      Pay slips must be issued to each employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       within 1 working day of pay day, even if an employee is on leave
      </li>
      <li>
       in electronic form or hard copy.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is best practice for pay slips to be written in plain and simple English.

      What information must be included on a pay slip?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Pay slips must contain details of the payments, deductions, and superannuation contributions for each pay period. The following information must be included on all pay slips issued to each employee as prescribed by the FW Act and the FW Regulations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pay slip must include all of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employer's name
      </li>
      <li>
       the employer's ABN (if any)
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee's name
      </li>
      <li>
       the date of payment
      </li>
      <li>
       the pay period
      </li>
      <li>
       the gross and net amount of payment
      </li>
      <li>
       any loadings (including casual loading), monetary allowances, bonuses, incentive-based payments, penalty rates, or other separately identifiable entitlement paid. For example, a note could be included on a pay slip that the hourly rate incorporates the relevant casual loading.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Additionally, where relevant, a pay slip must include any of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       if the employee is paid an hourly pay rate, the ordinary hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked at that rate and the amount of payment made at that rate
      </li>
      <li>
       if the employee is paid an annual rate of pay (salary), the rate as at the last day in the pay period
      </li>
      <li>
       any deductions made, including the name, or the name and number, of the fund or the account of each deduction
      </li>
      <li>
       if the employer is required to make superannuation contributions for the benefit of the employee:
       <ul>
        <li>
         the amount of each contribution the employer made or intends to make during the pay period
        </li>
        <li>
         the name, or name and number, of any superannuation fund into which the contributions were made or will be made.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      However, when an employer needs to give a new employee a pay slip within 14 days of their first pay day, they don’t have to include the superannuation fund name or number if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee hasn’t notified the employer of their choice of superannuation fund
      </li>
      <li>
       the employer hasn’t been able to obtain the employee’s stapled superannuation fund details from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
      </li>
     </ul>

     <p>
      Pay slips
      <strong>
       must not
      </strong>
      mention paid family and domestic violence leave, however you do need to keep a record of this leave balance and any leave taken by employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      This leave must be shown on a pay slip as ordinary hours of work, or another kind of payment for performing work such as an allowance, bonus or overtime payment. It is best practice to show this time on the pay slip in a way that makes it appear that the employee has not taken leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the pay slip may record the time as another type of leave (for example, annual leave) at the employee’s request. Find out more about

      What deductions may be made from an employee's pay?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Under the FW Act, an employer can only deduct money if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee agrees in writing (which must specify the amount) and it’s principally for their benefit
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s allowed by a law, a court order, or by the Fair Work Commission, or
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s allowed under the employee’s award, or
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s allowed under the employee’s registered agreement and the employee agrees to it.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Deductions that are commonly authorised include income tax deductions, voluntary superannuation or health insurance contributions, and trade union dues.
     </p>
     <p>
      A term in a registered agreement, an award, or contract of employment that allows for deductions has no effect if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the deduction is directly or indirectly for the benefit of the employer and is unreasonable
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee is under the age of 18 and the employee's parent or guardian has not authorised the deduction in writing.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The FW Regulations provide that certain deductions are to be treated as reasonable. These include, for example, the recovery of costs incurred through private use by the employee of a credit card, mobile phone, or petrol for a vehicle that has been provided by the employer.

      Best practice guidelines for issuing electronic pay slips
     </h2>
     <p>
      Electronic pay slips must be provided to an employee (unless issued a hard copy) and include the same information as hard copy pay slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       give electronic pay slips to each worker, such as via email or into an electronic personal account (employers should not simply store them on a database)
      </li>
      <li>
       issue electronic pay slips in an easily printable format.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      By way of best practice, employers should:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       issue electronic pay slips to employees securely and confidentially

      Contravention of record-keeping and pay slip obligations
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman may pursue a number of enforcement actions in relation to contraventions of record-keeping and pay slip obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors may issue an employer with an infringement notice for failing to meet their record-keeping and pay slip obligations under the FW Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      An infringement notice is similar to an on-the-spot fine and is an alternative to taking matters to court. An infringement notice can be issued within 12 months after the day on which the contravention(s) is alleged to have occurred. Generally, an employer has 28 days to pay the penalty in the infringement notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      For further information on Infringement Notices, including their payment, please see the

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employer's failure to meet their record-keeping obligations is serious, wilful or repetitive, Fair Work Inspectors may recommend the matter be taken to court.
     </p>
     <p>
      A court may impose penalties for record-keeping and pay slip contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      A court may also find that record-keeping contraventions are ‘serious contraventions’, attracting higher penalties, if they occurred knowingly and as part of a systematic pattern of conduct. Find the current maximum penalty amounts on our

      Making, keeping or providing false or misleading records or information
     </h2>
     <p>
      The FW Act prohibits a person from making or keeping employee records, or giving pay slips, which they know are false or misleading. It also prohibits a person from knowingly or recklessly providing false or misleading information or documents to the Fair Work Ombudsman, a Fair Work Inspector, or a FWO officer exercising certain powers. This includes omitting something from information that makes it false or misleading.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the false or misleading nature of the employee record, pay slip or information is material (for example it is not trivial), a court can impose penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases where the false records are made, kept or produced as part of a deliberate and systematic pattern of conduct, a court can impose significantly higher penalties for a 'serious contravention'.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some cases, knowingly giving or producing false or misleading information or documents to officials may also be a criminal offence.

      Other consequences of not meeting record-keeping or pay slip requirements
     </h2>
     <p>
      In addition to penalties for not keeping records, the FW Act includes a presumption in favour of a person who makes wage-related allegations in a court proceeding, where the employer has:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       failed to meet their record-keeping and pay slip obligations, or
      </li>
      <li>
       failed to make records available for inspection.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the person bringing the claim shows the employer didn’t comply with the record-keeping and/or pay slip requirement, the employer will be required to disprove the person’s wage-related allegation in court.
     </p>
     <p>
      This onus of disproving the allegation will not apply if the employer can show they had a reasonable excuse for not meeting the record-keeping, pay slip or record inspection obligation.
