      <strong>
       27 May 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Two Taiwanese backpackers were allegedly underpaid almost $40,000 while working as hairdressers in
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The male and female workers, aged in their 20s, were in Australia on 417 working holiday visas at the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two were allegedly short-changed a total of $39,144 between September, 2013 and May last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today announced it had commenced legal proceedings against
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      man Wei Wang.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Wang runs and part-owns two F10 Quick Cut outlets at the Arndale Shopping Centre at
      <strong>
       Kilkenny
      </strong>
      and the
      <strong>
       Elizabeth
      </strong>
      Shopping Centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing legal action is a company of which Mr Wang is the sole director, Sonisolar Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman claims the underpayment is largely the result of the workers being treated as contractors, rather than being provided with minimum employee entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were allegedly engaged six days a week and were paid amounts that resulted in an average rate of less than $10.50 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under Australia’s Hair and Beauty Industry Award, they were entitled to receive more than $17 an hour for normal hours and up to $38 an hour for weekend, overtime and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wages in lieu of notice and annual leave entitlements were allegedly also underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that the workers were underpaid $19,767 and $19,377 respectively and that Mr Wang was involved in some of the underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the workers turned to the Agency for help.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Wang and Sonisolar allegedly also breached workplace laws by failing to fully comply with two Notices to Produce employment records issued by Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record-keeping and pay-slip breaches are also alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action was initiated after Mr Wang and Sonisolar declined to co-operate with the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made repeated efforts to engage with this business operator to try to resolve the underpayment matter outside the Court, but were not able to secure sufficient co-operation,” she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges multiple contraventions of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Wang faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Sonisolar faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for full back-payment of the alleged underpayments, which remain outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for June 3 in the Federal Circuit Court in Adelaide.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers should be aware that the Fair Work Ombudsman treats underpayment of overseas workers very seriously.
     </p>
     <p>
      417 visa-holders have emerged as a strong priority for the Fair Work Ombudsman and their wages and conditions are the subject of a national Inquiry launched last August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers also need to be aware that the Fair Work Ombudsman is prepared to take legal action where employers fail to comply with Notices to Produce employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Enforcing compliance with Notices to Produce is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws and enabling inspectors to conduct thorough investigations,” she said.
