      Apprenticeships and traineeships combine:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       training with a registered training organisation, such as a TAFE or trade school
      </li>
      <li>
       practical work experience
      </li>
      <li>
       on the job training.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The type of qualification and the industry you work in will determine whether you need to complete an apprenticeship or traineeship.

     <p>
      You can complete an apprenticeship or traineeship with a new employer, or you can talk to your current employer about starting one.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apprenticeships and traineeships have to be registered with a state or territory training authority. You will have a training contract with your employer which outlines your rights and obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are timeframes for registering apprentices and trainees which vary from state to state. The period before the registration date can sometimes count towards the apprenticeship or traineeship.

      An apprentice or trainee is usually entitled to notice of termination, unless they're:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employed for a specified period, such as a training contract
      </li>

       </a>
       .

     </ul>
     <p>
      When you start your apprenticeship or traineeship you should talk to your employer about whether you’ll continue to work for them once your training is over. If you’re only going to be employed for the time of your apprenticeship or traineeship, then you won't get notice of termination when it ends.
     </p>

      It can help to look at your employment contract to see if you’ve been employed for a set period. For more information, see

       Jasmine is working for a logistics company as a trainee while she completes a Certificate III in Business Administration.

       Jasmine’s contract says she will be employed for 2 years while completing the traineeship.
