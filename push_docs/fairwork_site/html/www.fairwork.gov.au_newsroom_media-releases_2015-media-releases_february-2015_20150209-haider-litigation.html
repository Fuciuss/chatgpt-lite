      <strong>

     </p>
     <p>
      The operator of a 7-Eleven retail store in Brisbane will face court for allegedly underpaying an overseas worker more than $21,000 and refusing to co-operate with Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against Mubin Ul Haider, who owned and operated the 7-Eleven outlet at 243 Edwards Street in Brisbane until it closed last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing court is Mr Haider’s company, Haider Enterprises Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company allegedly underpaid an employee $21,298 - including minimum wages, casual loadings and penalty rates – over a period of just 13 months between January, 2013 and February, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee, from Nepal and aged in his late 20s, was a visa holder when he started working for Mr Haider. He is now a permanent resident of Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated after the employee lodged a complaint.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman issued two Notices to Produce (NTP) employment documents in May and June last year, but Haider Enterprises allegedly did not comply with them.
     </p>
     <p>
      There was allegedly also no response to a follow-up letter in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Haider and his company allegedly also failed to respond to a Compliance Notice (CN) issued in September and requiring the underpayment to be rectified within 17 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Notices to Produce and Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors - or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Compliance Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business operator to try to resolve the matter voluntarily, but were not been able to secure sufficient co-operation,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Haider faces maximum penalties between $5100 and $10,200 per breach and his company $25,500 to $51,000 per breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for the company to back-pay the employee in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says Fair Work inspectors identify underpayments at thousands of businesses nationally each year and resolve the vast majority by working co-operatively with employers, guiding them through the back-payment process and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they pay their staff correctly in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work inspectors will consider compliance action, including issuing Notices to Produce and Compliance Notices, which lawfully require employers to take prompt action.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Enforcing Compliance Notices and Notices to Produce is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We will not tolerate these Notices being deliberately ignored.”
