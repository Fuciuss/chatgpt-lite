      A Northern Territory refuge for women and children victims of domestic violence has back-paid 11 employees a total of more than $50,000, after intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>

      The not-for-profit
      <strong>
       Tennant Creek
      </strong>
      Women’s Refuge has committed to overhaul its workplace practices after inadvertently underpaying the all-female staff, who worked in crisis accommodation, counselling and outreach roles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors conducted a self-initiated audit of the organisation last year as part of a regional campaign in Alice Springs and the Barkly Region of the Northern Territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found the refuge had paid 11 full-time and casual employees flat hourly rates of between $26.75 and $37.79, which undercut some employees’ minimum ordinary hourly rates and resulted in underpayment of the higher rates they were entitled to for weekend and shift work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 11 employees were underpaid a total of $50,664 between July 2015 and June 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest individual underpayment was $14,374 of a crisis accommodation support worker who had received a flat rate of $34 for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services Award 2010
      </em>
      at the time, the worker was entitled to hourly rates of up to $40.87 for day shifts, up to $45.78 for night shifts, up to $49.05 on Saturdays and up to $65.40 on Sundays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tennant Creek Women’s Refuge fully co-operated with the investigation, agreeing to back-pay the employees in full and enter into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman focussed on future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the EU, the organisation must commission an external audit of its compliance with workplace laws across two financial years and rectify any contraventions found.
     </p>
     <p>
      It must also commission training on workplace laws for managerial staff, display workplace and newspaper notices detailing the contraventions and apologise to the workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The organisation must also advise all the entities which fund it that it has entered into the EU and register with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s My Account online portal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the underpayments were inadvertent and the result of the refuge not being fully aware of its obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This case highlights the importance of all employers ensuring they are fully aware of the minimum entitlements that apply to their employees,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are committed to helping employers rectify their non-compliance issues, but business operators need to make an effort to get the basics right in the first place.”
