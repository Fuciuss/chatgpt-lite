     <p>
      Employees get 2 days unpaid carer’s leave each time an immediate family member or household member of the employee needs care and support because of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       illness
      </li>
      <li>
       injury or
      </li>
      <li>
       an unexpected emergency.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Full-time and part-time employees can only get unpaid carer’s leave if they don’t have any paid sick / carer’s leave left.
     </p>
     <p>
      Find out who is an immediate family or household member on the
      <a href="/leave/sick-and-carers-leave/default">

     <p>
      Unpaid carer’s leave can be taken:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       in 1 continuous period (for example, 2 working days in a row) or
      </li>
      <li>
       in separate periods as agreed between the employee and employer (for example, 4 half days could be taken in a row).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employer can’t take negative action against an employee for taking unpaid carer’s leave. To find out more, see
