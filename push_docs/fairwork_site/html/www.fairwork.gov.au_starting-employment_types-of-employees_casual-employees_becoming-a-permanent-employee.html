      Accessing casual conversion
     </h2>
     <p>
      Casual employees who have worked for their employer for 12 months with a regular pattern of hours need to be offered the option to convert to full-time or part-time (permanent) employment. Certain eligibility requirements need to be met for this to occur.
     </p>
     <p>
      Casual employees may be able to request that their employer converts their employment to full-time or part-time (permanent) in some circumstances.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h3>
       Example: Regular pattern of hours
      </h3>
      <p>
       Dan is a casual employee who works every Friday and Saturday night at a restaurant on a regular basis. Their hours and days don’t change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over a 6-month period, Dan misses 2 shifts due to illness. By agreement with their employer, they also take 1 week off during university exams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though Dan has taken some time off, this still meets the definition of a ‘regular pattern of hours’. Dan may be able to access casual conversion.

     <p>
      An eligible casual employee working for a small business employer can request to convert to permanent employment at any time on or after their 12-month anniversary.
     </p>
     <p>
      To respond to an employee’s request to convert to permanent, employers need to write to them within 21 days and tell the employee if they have or haven’t accepted their request. If the employer refuses the request, they have to tell the employee their reasons why in their written response. Employers can’t refuse a request unless they have consulted the employee and have reasonable grounds to refuse the request. See

      can make a request at any time on or after their 12 month anniversary.

     <p>
      To be eligible to request casual conversion, a casual employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       needs to have been employed by the employer for at least 12 months
      </li>

      <li>
       they’ve refused an offer from their employer to convert to permanent employment
      </li>

      Casual employees who believe they’re eligible to become a permanent employee can make a request for conversion every 6 months.

      Sometimes employees can still make a request even if their employer has told them in the last 6 months that they won’t be making an offer of casual conversion. Employees can only do this if they didn’t get an offer because they hadn’t worked a regular pattern of work in the 6 months before their earlier request, but they now have.

After working there for 12 months, his employer writes to him telling him that they won’t be making an offer to convert his employment to permanent. The employer explains that Brett isn’t eligible because he’s only worked a regular pattern of work for the last 4 months.

      <p>
       Brett then continues to work a regular pattern of work for the next 2 months, meaning he has now worked a regular pattern of work for the last 6 months. He then checks he is eligible makes a written request to his employer to convert his employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brett’s employer has to consider his request even though they wrote to him 2 months ago. This is because Brett has now worked a regular pattern of work in the last 6 months of employment and has worked there for at least 12 months.

      Before a casual employee converts to permanent employment, their employer has to discuss with the employee their:

      <li>
       type of employment (full-time or part-time)
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
       start date as a permanent employee.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If a casual employee accepts an employer’s offer to convert, the employer needs to then confirm this information in writing to their employee within 21 days after the employee accepts their offer.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employer accepts a casual employee’s request to convert, the employer needs to then confirm this information in writing to their employee within 21 days after the employee has requested to convert. This can be in the same notice as when the employer tells the casual employee that they are accepting their request.
     </p>
     <p>
      The start date for the permanent hours is on the first day of the first full pay period after the employer has written to their employee, unless the employer and employee agree to another day. For example, if an employee’s pay period ends on Tuesday and the employer writes to the employee on Friday, then the start date for their permanent hours would be the following Wednesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a casual employee converts to permanent employment, they will be a full-time or part-time employee, even if a contract or other agreement entered into when their employment started says they are casual.

      Reasonable grounds for not making an offer or refusing a request
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employer decides to not make an offer, or refuses to accept a request, for a casual employee to convert to permanent on ‘reasonable grounds’, the reasonable grounds they rely on have to be based on facts that are known or reasonably foreseeable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reasonable grounds for deciding not to make an offer can include that, in the next 12 months:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee’s position won’t exist
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee’s hours of work will significantly reduce
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee’s days or times of work will significantly change, and that can’t be accommodated within the employee’s available days or times for work.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Reasonable grounds can also include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       making the offer would not comply with a recruitment or selection process required by or under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law

      An employer can’t reduce or change an employee’s hours of work, or terminate their employment, to avoid having to offer or accept a request for casual conversion. For example, an employer can’t deliberately change their employee’s roster so they don’t meet the eligibility requirements.

     <p>
      Casual employees are also protected against adverse action by an employer because they have a workplace right to convert to permanent employment. For more information on protections from adverse action, see
