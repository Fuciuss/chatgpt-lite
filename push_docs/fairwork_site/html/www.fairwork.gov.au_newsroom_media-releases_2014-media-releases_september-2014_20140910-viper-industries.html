      <strong>
       10 September 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former operator of a
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      hair and beauty business breached workplace laws by failing to back-pay a teenage apprentice hairdresser almost $6500, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is Viper Industries Pty Ltd, which formerly operated the Lattouf Hair and Day Spa Castle Hill as a franchise outlet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court is the company’s sole director and owner Jack Younes.
     </p>
     <p>
      An apprentice hairdresser at Mr Younes’ business was allegedly underpaid a total of $6471 - including minimum wages, penalty rates and leave entitlements -between July, 2012, and October, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apprentice was aged 18 and 19 at the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the alleged underpayment when they investigated a complaint from the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      In April, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice to Mr Younes and his company requiring the underpayment to be rectified within 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      They allegedly did not respond to either the Compliance Notice or a follow-up letter in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business operator to try to resolve the matter voluntarily, but were not been able to secure sufficient co-operation,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has previously received several complaints from young workers employed by Mr Younes - and had contacted him on at least 35 occasions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The number of complaints from workers and the lack of co-operation from Mr Younes is very concerning,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Young workers can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or are reluctant to complain, so we treat cases involving young workers particularly seriously.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Younes faces maximum penalty of $5100 and Viper Industries faces a maximum penalty of $25,500.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for Viper Industries to back-pay the apprentice in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for the matter on October 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said Fair Work inspectors identify underpayments at thousands of businesses nationally each year and resolve the vast majority by working co-operatively with employers, guiding them through the back-payment process and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they pay their staff correctly in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work inspectors will consider compliance action, including issuing Compliance Notices, which lawfully require employers to take prompt action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important for employers to understand that when a Compliance Notice is issued, the Fair Work Ombudsman is simply seeking to recover wages that should have been paid in the first instance - we are not seeking to be punitive,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Compliance Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Enforcing Compliance Notices is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Fair Work inspectors are increasingly issuing Compliance Notices in cases where employers with contravention issues refuse to co-operate and we will not tolerate these Compliance Notices being ignored.”
