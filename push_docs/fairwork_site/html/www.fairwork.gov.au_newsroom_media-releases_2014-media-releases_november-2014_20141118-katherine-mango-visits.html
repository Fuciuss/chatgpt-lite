      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors will visit mango farms around
      <strong>
       Katherine
      </strong>
      , NT, this week to ensure seasonal workers are being paid correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s Regional Services Team is making the site visits to up to 10 randomly-selected local properties as part of its three-year Harvest Trail project.
     </p>
     <p>
      The national project is in response to persistent complaints and concerns about the horticulture sector’s compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growers and labour-hire contractors will be asked to open their books, allowing inspectors to view records, with a particular emphasis on minimum pay rates, loadings and penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record keeping and pay slip obligations will also be monitored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier this month inspectors wrote to the employers to provide an education pack containing a copy of the
      <em>
       Horticulture Award 2010
      </em>
      , fact sheets and other resources to help them easily comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is important that mango growers and labour-hire contractors in Katherine understand their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says many farms in the area rely heavily on labour from overseas workers, in particular working holiday makers, and employees from a non-English speaking background who may not be fully aware of their workplace rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important that local employers understand and are complying with their workplace obligations,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Checking that employers are complying with their obligation to have written agreements in place for workers paid piece rates is also a key focus of the Harvest Trail program.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This is a really important issue. In the absence of a written piece rate agreement workers are required to be paid hourly pay rates,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will also visit local backpacker hostels where pickers may be staying to speak directly to them and provide them with information about their workplace rights.
