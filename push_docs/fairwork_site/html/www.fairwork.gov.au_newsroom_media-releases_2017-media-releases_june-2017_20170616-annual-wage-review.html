       The Fair Work Commission has announced an increase of 3.3 per cent to the national minimum wage following its annual wage review.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       From 1 July 2017, the national minimum wage will increase to $694.90 per week, or $18.29 per hour. The decision also affects base rates of pay in modern awards.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman is the agency responsible for ensuring that workplace participants were aware of their obligations and for providing information and assistance to employers when their obligations change.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers are encouraged to sign up to the Fair Work Ombudsman’s email updates to keep informed about when and where to access the latest information on the new wage rates.
      </span>

       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says her agency will soon be releasing updated versions of its educational material, including its Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “My agency is committed to educating and assisting employers to ensure they remain compliant with their workplace obligations,” Ms James said.
      </span>

       “The best way to remain informed and receive tailored information for your business is to register a free My Account with the Fair Work Ombudsman."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James said it was important that employers made themselves aware of the changes as soon as possible in order to ensure their workers received their correct entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Commission has also made changes to
      </span>
      <span>
       penalty rates affecting the Hospitality, Pharmacy, Fast Food, Retail and Restaurant industries. These also begin to come into effect on 1 July, 2017.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Commission will soon issue final determinations relating to the changes. Once this occurs the Fair Work Ombudsman will finalise the changes to its online tools.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “By signing up to our email updates, employers can make sure they receive immediate notification when our tools are updated and how the Fair Work Commission’s changes impact their business,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
