       The Fair Work Ombudsman will audit 365 textile, clothing and footwear businesses across Australia in the second phase of a national campaign aimed at building compliance with workplace laws across the industry.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The three-month campaign will check to ensure employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks to employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be monitored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Businesses to be scrutinised were provided with education materials last year in the first phase of the campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers in the industry - which is known to employ high numbers of vulnerable workers - are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Fair Work inspectors will offer tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure employers get things right in the future.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says employers must make an effort to ensure they understand the minimum wages applicable to their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Minimum pay rates are non-negotiable and they apply to everyone regardless of nationality and visa status.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, and a Pay and Conditions Tool.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Small business operators can also tap in to the suite of easy-to-follow courses at the Fair Work Ombudsman Online Learning Centre.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The free courses provide advice and guidance on issues including difficult conversations in the workplace, starting a new job, hiring employees and managing performance.
      </span>
     </p>
