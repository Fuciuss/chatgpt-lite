       A teenage Chinese massage therapist was underpaid more than $21,000 after being persuaded to work as an independent contractor instead of an employee, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The 19-year old, who spoke limited English, was paid a percentage of the cost of each massage she provided, when she should have received a minimum hourly wage.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Another male Chinese therapist, in his 20s, was also allegedly short-changed $33,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       As well as being underpaid, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges the two therapists had money unlawfully deducted from their wages for being late for work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It has commenced legal proceedings against the employer for sham contracting.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Facing court is Lu’s Healthcare Pty Ltd, which operates massage centres in
       <strong>
        Melbourne’s CBD
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Richmond
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Frankston
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Also facing legal action is business manager Kun Wang, of Melbourne.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman claims Lu’s Healthcare and Ms Wang breached workplace law when they convinced the two therapists to work under their own Australian Business Number (ABN).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The therapists were allegedly told that they would have to pay an “administrative fee” if they wanted to be employed using a Tax File Number (TFN).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman says the two therapists should have been classified as employees and paid under the
       <em>
        Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2010
       </em>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The two worked primarily at Lu’s Healthcare Richmond at the Victoria Gardens shopping centre.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman says neither was conducting their own business and Lu’s Healthcare and Ms Wang exercised control over the way they performed their duties.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Court documents allege the workers should have been paid minimum hourly rates, a laundry allowance, casual loadings and penalty rates for overtime, shift, weekend and public holiday work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is further alleged that hundreds of dollars were unlawfully taken from their wages for being late for work – a breach of the business’ formal ‘Code of Conduct’.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Code lists a range of transgressions for which certain amounts would be arbitrarily taken from their take-home pay.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fines of up to $100 applied for being late to work or absent without notice.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       For a ‘lack of passion or good hospitality’, therapists could be fined $50 – and for talking or speaking on the phone during a massage, they could lose their jobs.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under a ‘disturbance of the work environment’ category, employees could be fined $20 for ‘noise making or playing around’ and sleeping or lying on massage tables.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The punishment for ‘resistance to hard work’ was being ‘put back into apprenticeship again’. The Code also stated that ‘employees with other problems will undergo serious punishment’.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the Code of Conduct, as well as the alleged underpayments, when it investigated complaints lodged by the two therapists.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The pair were allegedly underpaid a total of more than $54,000 between December, 2011 and June, 2013. Record-keeping and pay slip laws were allegedly also breached.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the significant amounts involved for vulnerable workers and the failure of the employer to co-operate with the Agency’s investigation were significant factors in the decision to litigate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were only back-paid in December after court proceedings began.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We are very conscious that there are a number of young and vulnerable employees in this industry and businesses need to be aware that there will be consequences if they blatantly contravene workplace laws,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Deductions from wages are generally unlawful if they are not authorised by the employee in accordance with workplace law and are not principally for the benefit of the employee.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “In this case, we will allege in Court that the deductions were arbitrary and used as a form of punishment, which is unlawful,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Employers also need to realise that classifying a worker as a contractor and asking them to obtain an ABN does not automatically make them a contractor in the eyes of the law.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “
      </span>
      <span>
       When our inspectors suspect misclassification or sham contracting is occurring, we will look carefully to determine the true state of affairs.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms Wang was allegedly involved in Lu’s Healthcare committing several breaches of workplace laws. She faces possible penalties of up to $10,200 per breach. The company faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per breach.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on February 19.
