You’ll also have the opportunity to sign up for some of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s free online education tools and resources to help you understand your workplace rights which are the same rights as all workers in Australia.

      We will also ask you how your work opportunities and/or arrangements may have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic so that we can better tailor materials for international students, just like yourself in the future.
