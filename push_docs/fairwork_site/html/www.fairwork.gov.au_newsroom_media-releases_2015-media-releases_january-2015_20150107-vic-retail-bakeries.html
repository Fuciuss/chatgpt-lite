      Retail bakeries in
      <strong>
       Victoria
      </strong>
      need to pay greater attention to employee pay rates, the Fair Work Ombudsman said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost half of businesses randomly audited recently were paying incorrect wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than 200 employees were found to have been underpaid almost $150,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      A quarter of the underpayments were the result of the bakeries underpaying penalty rates and shift loadings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other factors included underpayment of the minimum hourly rate and a failure to pay overtime, casual loadings, allowances and public holiday penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors also identified instances of employers neglecting to pay employees for some time worked and not providing applicable meal breaks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman targeted retail bakeries in response to analysis of its 2012 complaints data.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of 131 complaints received from workers in the bakery product manufacturing sector, 70 per cent were from employees of retail bakeries – and almost two-thirds of these were found to have been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Key stakeholders were consulted on the campaign, including the Baking Industry Association, Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and major franchisors Baker’s Delight and Brumbies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors audited a total of 81 bakeries across the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      They found that only 63 per cent (51) were fully compliant with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations under federal workplace laws and only 53 per cent (43) were paying their employees correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thirty-three employers were requested to back-pay 211 workers a total of $146,923.
     </p>
     <p>
      The range of underpayments varied from as little as $80 at one business up to $24,000 at another, with an average underpayment per business of $3141.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the findings highlight that small mistakes, left over time, can result in hefty bills for back-payment of wages that employers had not budgeted for.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers were welcoming and willing to positively engage with inspectors and acted swiftly to rectify their errors and put systems and processes in place to ensure future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
