      Ten workers at
      <strong>
       Dubbo
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Orange
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Parkes
      </strong>
      in regional NSW have been back-paid more than $43,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Dubbo, the operator of a retail business has reimbursed $20,000 to a family member employed for more than 10 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business failed to pay the employee’s accrued annual and long service entitlements when the family member’s employment ended.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the employee lodged a request for assistance with the Fair Work Ombudsman, inspectors apprised the business of its obligations under workplace laws and the outstanding entitlements were promptly reimbursed.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, a mechanic who had worked at a business in
      <strong>
       Orange
      </strong>
      for 12 years was back-paid $12,100 after his accrued annual leave entitlements were not paid following the sale of the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      And in
      <strong>
       Parkes
      </strong>
      , eight employees at a local business were back-paid a total of $11,300 after their minimum hourly rate was inadvertently underpaid between July, 2013 and June, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the cases highlight the need for regional NSW employers to ensure they understand the minimum wage rates applicable to their workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s particularly important employers pay all outstanding entitlements at the end of the employment relationship, because termination entitlements can play a crucial role in supporting workers if they need to look for a new job,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is also important to note that employees in family businesses have the same right to lawful minimum entitlements as other employees.
