      Daily hire employees
     </h2>
     <p>
      Before employment begins, employers have to tell employees in writing what they're employed as. This can be daily hire, weekly hire (full-time or part-time) or casual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Daily hire employees are similar to full-time and part-time employees. They still get entitlements such as annual leave and sick leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Daily hire employees have the following entitlements:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       they are entitled to get or give 1 days notice to end their employment
      </li>
      <li>
       a tradesperson will be allowed 1 hour before termination to collect, clean, sharpen and transport their tools
      </li>
      <li>
       they receive a follow the job loading.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The follow the job loading is part of their hourly pay rate. It compensates for time that they aren't working between jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Daily hire employees can work full-time or part-time hours.
     </p>
