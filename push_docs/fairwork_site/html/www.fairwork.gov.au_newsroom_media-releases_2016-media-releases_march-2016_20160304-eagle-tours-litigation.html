      <strong>
       4 March 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A Sydney transport company is facing the Federal Circuit Court for allegedly short-changing four bus drivers more than $47,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Eagle Tours Pty Ltd, which provides professional coach charter services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eagle Tours allegedly underpaid four bus drivers a total of $47,640 between November, 2012 and February, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drivers were allegedly paid flat rates of $22 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      These rates allegedly resulted in underpayment of casual loadings, overtime rates and penalty rates for weekend, public holiday, night and early morning work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Passenger Vehicle Transportation Award
      </em>
      , the former employees were entitled to receive as much as $38.94 an hour on weekends and $48.68 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman argues that all four drivers should have been classified as casual employees, but three were misclassified as independent contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eagle Tours has a contract with Transport Sydney Trains to provide shuttle bus services to transfer Transport Sydney Trains crew between stations and maintenance centres.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman says the contract price paid by Transport Sydney Trains was enough for Eagle Tours to pay drivers their minimum lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eagle Tours has subsequently made some back-payments, but more than $41,000 of the alleged underpayment remains outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence litigation because of the seriousness of the alleged contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eagle Tours faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention and the Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for Eagle Tours to back-pay workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order requiring Eagle Tours to display a workplace notice detailing employee entitlements and to commission a professional audit of its compliance with workplace laws and report the results to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for May 13 in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
