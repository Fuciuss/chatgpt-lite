      Food services and hospitality company Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd is the latest major employer to enter a partnership with the Fair Work Ombudsman to continue to improve its workplace practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company has made workplace compliance a high priority by signing a Proactive Compliance Deed (PCD) with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new agreement aims to ensure that more than 14,000 employees at Compass Group’s 600-plus sites across Australia receive their correct entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company specialises in providing catering and other support services across a wide range of market sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James welcomed the Compass Group’s decision to join a growing list of employers signing Proactive Compliance Deeds.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Compass acknowledges there are always opportunities for continuous improvement in the workplace, and it is now seeking out these opportunities,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “By signing up to this Deed, the company is demonstrating its commitment to harmonious, productive and co-operative workplaces,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      McDonald’s signed the Fair Work Ombudsman’s first Proactive Compliance Deed in April, 2011 and recently renewed it.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Deed provides Compass with a great opportunity for improvement across a range of areas in the business which will have a positive impact on relationships with its staff, and also the bottom line,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the terms of the Deed, the Fair Work Ombudsman will refer workplace queries it receives from employees back to Compass for resolution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compass has appointed a dedicated staff member to handle inquiries from its employees about their wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      A full report on all the matters handled will be provided to the Fair Work Ombudsman after 12 months, including the number of complaints, the time taken to resolve them and any underpayments rectified.
     </p>
     <p>
      All Compass employees have been advised of the initiative.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman website – www.fairwork.gov.au - has a range of free tools and resources employers can use to ensure they are meeting their obligations under workplace laws.
