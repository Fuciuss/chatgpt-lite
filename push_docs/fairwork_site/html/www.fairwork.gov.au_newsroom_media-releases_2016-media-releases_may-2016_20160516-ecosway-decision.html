     <p>
      The Federal Court has dismissed the Fair Work Ombudsman’s legal action against an international retail company.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2013, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action Ecosway Pty Ltd, which sold a range of health care, nutrition and beauty-related products through dozens of stores across Australia at that time, as well as through a direct marketing network of 'business owners'.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleged that the company engaged in sham contracting activity that resulted in a worker it had engaged to operate its stores at Unley and Kensington Park, in
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      , being underpaid more than $32,000 in 2011-2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was alleged that Ecosway breached sham contracting laws when it misrepresented to the worker that she was an independent contractor when her correct classification was as an employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Court has now ruled that the worker's correct classification was an independent contractor and dismissed the allegations made by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
