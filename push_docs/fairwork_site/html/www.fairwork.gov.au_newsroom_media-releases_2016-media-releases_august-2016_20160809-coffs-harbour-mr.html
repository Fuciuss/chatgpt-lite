      <strong>

     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Ombudsman investigation has found a business near
      <strong>
       Coffs Harbour
      </strong>
      on the NSW Mid-North Coast failed to pay correct annual leave entitlements and calculate accurate leave balances for its shift workers for six years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer miscalculated the leave balances of 75 workers and underpaid 61 employees a total of almost $54,700 in annual leave entitlements. Some employees were affected by both the underpayments and miscalculations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Four successive workplace agreements provided the employees with an extra week of annual leave every year and annual leave loading that included shift penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      A query from a single employee who believed the agreement was being incorrectly applied sparked the Fair Work Ombudsman investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The highest amount a worker was underpaid was $4330 and the largest correction to an annual leave balance was 70.59 hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business promptly back-paid outstanding leave entitlements and corrected leave balances of the affected former and current employees following extensive dealings with the Agency and checks by an external auditor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the employer should have had systems in place to monitor and correctly calculate its employees’ annual leave entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, she says it is pleasing the employer co-operated with Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This is an example of an employer who, when approached by the Fair Work Ombudsman, recognised that its management practices led to significant employee underpayments and
      <strong>
      </strong>
      worked with the Agency to rectify the problem," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Understanding complex agreements and workplace laws is fundamental good business practice."
     </p>
     <p>
      She said most underpayments were inadvertent and the result of employers failing to check their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      She encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on
