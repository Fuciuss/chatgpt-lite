      Independent contractors

     <p>
      Independent contractors have different rights and obligations to employees. They provide services to another person or business and aren’t employees of that person or business. They negotiate their own fees and working arrangements. Minimum pay rates also don’t apply.

      Minimum pay rates
     </h3>
     <p>
      For most employees, the minimum wage is set by the award that covers their industry or occupation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minimum wage refers to the amount of pay before tax is taken out (gross pay).
     </p>
     <p>
      Some employees have a different minimum wage depending on their employment type, age or work capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an award covers an employee, they’ll be paid based on their classification in the award. Classifications are descriptions of roles and types of work. They’re often referred to as levels or grades. Find more information on our

      Junior rates
     </h4>
     <p>
      A junior employee (under 21 years of age) is paid a percentage of the relevant adult pay rate under their award or registered agreement. However, sometimes there are no specific junior rates or another rate applies.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">

      <p>
       Luca is 19 and serves alcohol at a wine bar on weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luca is covered by the Hospitality Award. Under this award, Luca would normally receive the junior rate for 19-year-olds. However, the award provides that a liquor service employee receives the full adult rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, Luca receives the adult rate rather than the junior rate for 19-year-olds.

      Your employer must pay you for all hours you work and any compulsory time spent for work. This includes time any time you spend opening or closing a store, or compulsory training or a meeting. For example, if your employer has told you to be at work at 7:45am to open the shop at 8am, they must pay you from 7:45am.

      Your employer must also pay you in money for all work you perform. They can’t pay you with goods such as food. This is also known as ‘payment in kind’ and is illegal.

      Can my employer deduct money from me?
     </h3>
     <p>
      There are times an employer can deduct money from your pay. For example, tax has to be deducted from your pay. Any other deduction can only happen if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       you agree in writing and it’s principally for your benefit
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s allowed by a law, a court order or the Fair Work Commission
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s allowed under your award, or
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s allowed under your registered agreement and you agree to it.
      </li>

      An example of this is authorising your employer to make additional payments into your super fund.

        Example: Can’t deduct money for cash discrepancies
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Charlotte works in a gift shop as a cashier.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the staff are closing the store on Saturday evening, Simon (the manager) announces that the amount in the till is $100 less than what it should be. He tells Charlotte that he will be deducting $100 from her pay to make up for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simon can’t do this. An employer can’t deduct money from an employee for a cash discrepancy.

      Can my work be unpaid?
     </h3>
     <p>
      There are different types of work arrangements that can be unpaid, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       student placements
      </li>
      <li>
       work experience and internships
      </li>
      <li>
       unpaid trials.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h4>
      Unpaid work trials
     </h4>
     <p>
      Unpaid work trials are only okay for as long as needed to demonstrate the skills required for the job. Before starting a new job you might be asked to perform a trial. Depending on the nature of the work, this could range from an hour to one shift. Before you start the trial, it should be made clear to you that it is an unpaid trial.

      <p>
       Jason has been asked to do an unpaid trial to make coffee at a cafe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial lasts 5 hours. In addition to making coffee, Jason is also asked to clean the bathrooms, take out the garbage and sweep up the cafe.
      </p>
      <p>
       These activities go beyond demonstrating the skills required for the job. Jason should be paid for the time worked.

     <h4>
      Internships and work placements
     </h4>
     <p>
      Internships or unpaid work placements can be lawfully unpaid when they are part of an approved job training or work experience program or vocational placement and the work is done in accordance with the relevant program or placement.
