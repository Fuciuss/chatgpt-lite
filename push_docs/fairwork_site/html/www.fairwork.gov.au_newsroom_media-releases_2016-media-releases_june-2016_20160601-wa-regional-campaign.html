       The Fair Work Ombudsman is auditing up to 150 businesses across Western Australia’s Great Southern and South-West regions as part of a new campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The campaign is focusing on businesses located in and around
       <strong>
        Albany,
       </strong>
       <strong>
        Manjimup, Donnybrook
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Katanning
       </strong>
       and will run until July.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors will conduct checks to ensure employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, overtime and penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be assessed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The campaign earmarked the Great Southern and South-West regions because they have been an increasing source of requests for assistance from workers to the Fair Work Ombudsman in recent years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Road freight transport businesses, pubs, taverns and bars, and residential property operators in
       <strong>
        Manjimup
       </strong>
       and farms in
       <strong>
        Albany
       </strong>
       are being examined.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Accommodation, cafes and restaurants and grain sheep and beef cattle farming businesses in both towns will also be audited.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Key local employer groups and unions were advised of the campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says businesses will be selected for audit at random and the campaign will include many businesses with no history of non-compliance issues.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the campaign aims to promote awareness among employers of their workplace responsibilities and demonstrate the various ways the Agency can help them access, understand and apply information to boost their compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Inspectors can offer employers tailored assistance to resolve any non-compliance issues and develop processes to place businesses on the right path.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Resources include templates for time-and-wages records and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers and employees seeking assistance can also contact the Fair Work Infoline on
       <strong>
        13 13 94
       </strong>
       . A free interpreter service is available by calling
       <strong>
        13 14 50
