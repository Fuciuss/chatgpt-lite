      A farming waste company in regional NSW that underpaid 16 truck drivers nearly $94,000 is back-paying the workers and overhauling its workplace practices, following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Deniliquin
      </strong>
      -based company Downes Rice Hulls Pty Ltd short-changed the workers, mainly as a result of underpaying their overtime and weekend penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Downes Rice Hulls collects and transports rice hulls in the NSW Riverina region and has major depots in
      <strong>
       Leeton
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Deniliquin
      </strong>
      . It formerly also had a depot at
      <strong>
       Coleambally
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after receiving a request for assistance from a driver who had previously been employed out of the
      <strong>
       Leeton
      </strong>
      depot and found the worker had been underpaid $50,856 between 2011 and 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman found that the worker, aged in his 50s, was paid a $24 hourly base rate, $25 for night-shift work and $27 for overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, under the
      <em>
       Waste Management Award 2010
      </em>
      at the time, he was entitled to overtime rates of between $31.91 and $42.54, up to $42.54 on Sundays and up to $63.81 on Christmas Day and Good Friday. His afternoon and night-shift loadings were also underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman then conducted a wider audit and identified that similar issues had led to Downes Rice Hulls underpaying a further 15 full-time or casual workers a total of $43,138 across a three-month period from January to March, last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also failed to pay annual leave loading and contravened record-keeping laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Downes Rice Hulls has entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman, committing to rectify all underpayments within 12 months and to take a range of steps aimed at ensuring future compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      This includes commissioning external audits of its compliance and rectifying any contraventions found; ensuring all managerial staff complete training on their workplace obligations; displaying public notices in its workplaces detailing the contraventions; providing written apologies to the workers; and signing up to the Fair Work Ombudsman’s My Account online portal.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company has also agreed to donate $5000 to the GetSet employment readiness program for young people in Leeton.
     </p>

      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the case highlights the importance of employers ensuring they are aware of the minimum entitlements that apply to their employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are committed to helping employers rectify their non-compliance issues, but business operators need to make an effort to get the basics right in the first place,” Ms James said.
