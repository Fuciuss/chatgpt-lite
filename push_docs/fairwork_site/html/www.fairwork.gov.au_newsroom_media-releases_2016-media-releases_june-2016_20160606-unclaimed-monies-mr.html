       The Fair Work Ombudsman is on the hunt for thousands of workers owed a total of more than $2 million by their former employers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Agency is currently holding $2.18 million in trust for 9467 people who were underpaid in a former job but who cannot be located.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The unpaid wages and entitlements were collected as a result of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s campaign work, pro-active auditing and investigations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Last financial year, the agency recovered more than $22.3 million in underpaid wages and entitlements for 11,613 workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       When an employee owed money cannot be located, their entitlements are held in trust and ongoing efforts are made to trace them.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says 116 people are owed amounts of $2000 or more while 343 are owed more than $1000 and 824 are owed more than $500.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says that the Agency’s Unclaimed Moneys Team has recently been able to locate 218 people and send them cheques for a total of $413,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman recently launched a social media campaign in a bid to find workers who are owed wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Anyone who thinks they may have been short-changed in a former job can visit our website and use our Online tool to check if they are on our list,” Ms James says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It is also an opportunity for employers and employees alike to do a health check on the compliance of their workplace and wages.’’
