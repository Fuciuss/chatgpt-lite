      <strong>
       2 October 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A national security company is again facing Court action after allegedly underpaying a
      <strong>
       Gold Coast
      </strong>
      worker more than $7000 in just 10 weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Security International Services Pty Ltd in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company allegedly underpaid the security guard a total of $7632 between November, 2013 and February, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Security International Services allegedly made irregular payments to the worker that were not sufficient to meet his minimum entitlements under the
      <em>
       Security Services Industry Award
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges the worker was underpaid his minimum hourly rate and penalty rates for night, weekend and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Underpayment of annual leave entitlements and contravention of pay-slip laws is also alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the worker contacted the Agency for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the underpayment has now been rectified.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, litigation will proceed given the significant amount of the alleged underpayment over such a short period of time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Security International Services faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order that Security International Services commission an audit of its compliance with workplace laws, report the results to the Agency and rectify any underpayments discovered.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for October 7.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the Fair Work Ombudsman’s second legal action against Security International Services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency commenced legal action against the company last year, alleging it breached workplace laws by knowingly allowing one of its contractors, GRI Global, to underpay a Queensland security guard more than $11,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter is still before the Federal Circuit Court.
