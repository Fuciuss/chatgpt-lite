      <strong>
       1 October 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Two backpackers and an international student from Korea have been short-changed almost $40,000 by a café operator in Sydney’s CBD, an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman has found.
     </p>
     <p>
      The three females, who spoke little English, were paid the equivalent of as little as $5.05 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were short-changed over nine months last year while working at two Incanto Coffee outlets, on Kent Street and George Street.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two worked as food and beverage attendants and one worked as a cook.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman about their wages before returning to South Korea.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors subsequently identified that the employees had been underpaid minimum wages, casual loadings, penalty rates, overtime and annual leave entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees should have been paid according to the Restaurant Industry Award, under which they were entitled to a minimum hourly rate of $24.19 for normal hours and up to $43.38 for public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were underpaid amounts of $17,807, $10,812 and $10,129 respectively - a total of $38,748 - for work performed between April and December, 2014. Record keeping and pay slip laws were also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner-operators of the cafes - Kyung Jun Kim and his company Marsil Pty Ltd - have back-paid the workers in full and signed an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman to ensure future compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Kim and Marsil have agreed to engage an independent expert to audit the company’s compliance within 18 months and report back to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, Mr Kim is required to undertake workplace relations training and register with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s online tool My Account.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Kim is a Korean national who dealt with the Fair Work Ombudsman through an interpreter. He advertised for his staff on Korean websites.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors are increasingly finding cases of employers from non-English speaking backgrounds not appreciating the seriousness of failing to comply with their obligations under workplace relations laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is important that there be a fair, competitive environment for employers who are doing the right thing by creating a level playing field in relation to business costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Anyone operating a business, including migrants, needs to ensure they take the time to understand the workplace laws applicable to their business,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit www.fairwork.gov.au
