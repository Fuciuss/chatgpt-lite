     <p>
      The Respect at Work Amendment Act aims to make sure more workers are protected and empowered to address unlawful sexual harassment in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Respect at Work Amendment Act has changed the Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act) by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       introducing definitions of ‘sexually harass’ and ‘sexually harassed at work’
      </li>
      <li>
       expanding the anti-bullying jurisdiction of the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) to allow it to make orders to stop sexual harassment at work
      </li>
      <li>
       clarifying that sexual harassment in connection with an employee’s employment can be a valid reason for dismissal.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Respect at Work Amendment Act also enables an employee to access their compassionate leave entitlement if the employee or their current spouse or de facto partner has a miscarriage.
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      The Respect at Work amendment also updated the Sex Discrimination Act to prohibit conduct that results in a hostile workplace environment on the basis of gender for all employees and potential employees.

      Sexual harassment
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Respect at Work Amendment Act has defined sexual harassment under the FW Act as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an unwelcome sexual advance
      </li>
      <li>
       an unwelcome request for sexual favours
      </li>
      <li>
       other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to another person.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      To be sexual harassment, it has to be reasonable to expect that there is a possibility that the person being harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by the behaviour.

      Orders to stop sexual harassment
     </h2>
