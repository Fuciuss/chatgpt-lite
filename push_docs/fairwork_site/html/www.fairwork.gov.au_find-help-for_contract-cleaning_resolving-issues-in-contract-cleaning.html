     <h3>
      Concerns about visas
     </h3>
     <p>
      It's important for employers and employees to know the rules of an employee’s visa. Some visas have rules about how many hours employees can work or where they can work.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer can't cancel an employee’s visa, even if the employee has breached their visa conditions. Only Home Affairs can grant, refuse or cancel visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Visa holders can seek help without fear of visa cancellation, even if they've breached their work-related visa conditions. This arrangement with Home Affairs is called the Assurance Protocol. Find out more at

       Example: Resolving problem of not being paid for all time worked
      </h3>
      <p>
       Sun-Young has just started working for a company that cleans large shopping centres. Before her first shift she is required to attend a training session to learn about their procedures, the cleaning products they use and the tasks she must do each day.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Sun-Young checks her first pay slip she notices she has not been paid for the training session. She has also not been paid for the time it takes her to collect and load the cleaning cart in the morning, or to return and unload the cleaning cart in the afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sun-Young reads about unpaid work on fairwork.gov.au. She learns that because she had to attend the training, she must be paid for it. She must also be paid for all hours that the company requires her to work, including the time it takes her to collect and return the cleaning cart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sun-Young brings the issue to her employer Michael’s attention. She gives him the information that she found and asks him to respond, letting him know that she may request assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman if he doesn’t reply. Michael thanks Sun-Young for letting him know. Michael says that the company will back pay Sun-Young the money she is owed in her next pay.
