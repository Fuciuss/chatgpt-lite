      Right to not work on a public holiday
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employees should be given the choice to work on a public holiday or not.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers can request employees to work on a public holiday but the request has to be reasonable.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee can refuse a request to work if the:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employee has reasonable grounds, or
      </li>
      <li>
       request is unreasonable.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      When deciding if an employee will be rostered to work on a public holiday, employers should consider:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the nature of the workplace
      </li>
      <li>
       the role and type of work of the employee does
      </li>
      <li>
       employee’s personal circumstances (including caring responsibilities)
      </li>
      <li>
       employment status (full-time, part-time or casual)
      </li>
      <li>
       an expectation that they might be asked to work on the public holiday
      </li>
      <li>
       any overtime, penalty rates or other payment the employee might receive
      </li>
      <li>
       the amount of notice provided
      </li>
      <li>
       any other relevant factor.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employer can require an employee to work a public holiday if the:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employer has made a reasonable request for the employee to work the public holiday
      </li>
      <li>
       employee has unreasonably refused that request.
      </li>
     </ul>

      Base pay rates
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employees (except casual employees) who normally work on the day a public holiday falls will be paid their base pay rate for the ordinary hours they would have worked if they had not been away because of the public holiday.
     </p>
     <p>
      The base pay rate doesn’t include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       any incentive-based payments
      </li>
      <li>
       bonuses
      </li>
      <li>
       loadings
      </li>
      <li>
       monetary allowances
      </li>
      <li>
       overtime or
      </li>
      <li>
       penalty rates.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employee's roster can't be changed to deliberately avoid this payment.

       Wednesday 1 January is New Year’s Day, which is a public holiday, so Claire has the day off. Even though Claire doesn't go to work, she still gets her base pay rate for the ordinary hours she would have normally worked. She is not entitled to payment for the overtime hours.

      Public holidays during leave
     </h2>
     <p>
      If a public holiday falls when an employee is on leave, their entitlement to the public holiday depends on whether they are taking paid leave or unpaid leave.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Paid leave and public holidays
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a public holiday falls during a period of paid leave (for example, annual leave or sick leave), the employee has to be paid for the public holiday. This includes any hours that fall on a part-day public holiday.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if the employee is taking annual leave at the same time as unpaid parental leave, they won't be paid for the public holiday.
     </p>
     <p>
      The public holiday will not be counted as annual leave or sick leave. This means that the public holiday hours will not be taken away from the employee's amount of built-up paid leave.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h3>
       Example: Public holidays during a period of annual leave
      </h3>
      <p>
       Marissa is a full-time employee who organises to take paid annual leave for 10 days. This period includes Anzac Day, which is a public holiday and falls on a Monday.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Monday is a day Marissa is regularly rostered to work, she has to be paid for the Anzac Day public holiday. The public holiday won't be taken from her annual leave amount. This means that only 9 days are deducted from Marissa's annual leave balance.
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      If an employee takes sick leave either side of a public holiday, they should still be paid for the public holiday if it is on a day that they would normally work. Normal sick leave rules apply for the time taken as sick leave and an employer can ask the employee for evidence that shows the reason they took the leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee is rostered to work on a public holiday on a day they don’t normally work, and calls in sick, they don’t get paid for that day.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee is taking long service leave on a public holiday, whether an employee gets paid for the public holiday is set out in the state or territory long service leave legislation.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Unpaid leave and public holidays
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employee isn’t paid for any public holiday that falls during a time when the employee is on unpaid leave.
