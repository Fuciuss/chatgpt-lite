      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against the operators of an excavation business based in
      <strong>
       north-west Victoria
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing court is Theill Pipelines Pty Ltd and the company’s sole director, Garry Vincent O’Neill.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges the company and Mr O’Neill breached the Fair Work Act by failing to comply with a Compliance Notice requiring the company to calculate and back-pay any outstanding amounts owing to an employee who worked as an excavator operator for the company between 2009 and his termination in January 2019.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors commenced an investigation into the company, based at Irymple near Mildura in north-west Victoria, last year after receiving a request for assistance from the employee. Most of the employee’s work for the company was in Queensland.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice was issued after a Fair Work Inspector formed a belief that the employee had not been paid redundancy pay and annual leave loading owed under the
      <em>
       Building and Construction General On-site Award 2010
      </em>
      , and unused annual leave under the Fair Work Act.
      <em>
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors issued Theill Pipelines with a Compliance Notice requiring the company to calculate and rectify the alleged underpayments and produce reasonable evidence of its compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker says Compliance Notices are an important tool to recover unpaid wages, and they will be enforced where they are not followed.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, inspectors can issue a Compliance Notice if they form a belief that an employer has breached certain workplace laws. Where employers do not comply with our notices, a court can order them to pay penalties in addition to back-paying any affected employees.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Fair Work Ombudsman will continue to use all its enforcement tools to ensure employers meet their lawful obligations,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is seeking penalties against Theill Pipelines Pty Ltd and Mr O’Neill. The company faces a maximum penalty of $31,500, while Mr O’Neill faces a maximum penalty of $6,300.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a court order requiring the company to take the action required by the Compliance Notice, including calculating any payments owing and rectifying them in full, plus superannuation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing has been listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne for 24 March 2020.
