      The Fair Work Ombudsman has alleged contempt of court by a Northern Queensland business operator by contravening a freezing order that applies to funds in his company’s accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing the Federal Circuit Court is Leigh Alan Jorgensen, the owner-operator of a
      <strong>
       Cairns
      </strong>
      company trading as Trek North Tours.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contempt of court application against Jorgensen relates to allegations in respect of a freezing order the Fair Work Ombudsman secured against Mr Jorgensen’s company in 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court made the freezing orders preventing any dispersion of Jorgensen’s and his company’s assets. The orders were to apply until such time that penalties and back-payments from the litigation relating to underpayment of wages were complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Jorgensen subsequently paid the penalty imposed on him personally into Court, resulting in the freezing order against him being lifted.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Mr Jorgensen’s company has failed to pay its penalty and failed to back-pay workers, resulting in the freezing order against his company remaining in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman now alleges that in August 2015, Jorgensen committed contempt of court when he contravened the freezing order against his company by transferring a total of $41,035 from two company accounts into his family trust account.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Kristen Hannah said the agency was committed to ensuring all workers receive their lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter is listed for a directions hearing in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane on December 5.
