      <strong>
       16 October 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The popularity of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s self-help online pay tool, PayCheck Plus, has hit an all-time high, with almost 900,000 visits so far this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The use of PayCheck Plus increased by almost 23 per cent in the nine months to the end of September, compared to the same time last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      PayCheck Plus is available at www.fairwork.gov.au and calculates minimum wages - including any overtime, penalty rates or allowances that may apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Executive Director Michael Clark says the number of people accessing the Agency’s online tools is encouraging.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Many employers and employees obviously now prefer to use the website to get the information they need on wages and conditions,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This shift is allowing our Infoline advisers to focus on more complex telephone inquiries and to prioritise calls from small business.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Clark says the Fair Work Ombudsman is committed to providing accessible, reliable and accurate information for both employers and employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      In August, the Fair Work Infoline was recognised for its exceptional customer service at the Government Contact Centre Excellence Awards, winning the ‘Best Service’ category.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Infoline has recently launched an online tool called My account to enable callers to save the advice they receive, together with any regularly-used website materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      With more than 10 million visits a year, 25 per cent of them accessed from mobile devices, the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website is a popular destination for workplace relations advice and information.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website, which was revamped in June, can assist people with basic information, but also provides tools and resources for those who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, the site now features an interactive Online Learning Centre with a range of free online courses on topics such as having difficult conversations in the workplace, hiring employees and managing performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit the website or call the Infoline on

      . A free interpreter service is available by calling

      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     Small business employers calling the Infoline can opt to be put through to the Small Business Helpline to receive priority service and they can sign up to a regular E-newsletter.
