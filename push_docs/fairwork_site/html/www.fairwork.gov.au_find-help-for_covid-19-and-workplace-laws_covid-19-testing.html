      Getting tested
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employees may get tested for COVID-19 for several reasons, including when they have COVID-19 symptoms or are a close contact. Some of these reasons might be connected to their work. State or territory health departments’ websites contain guidance about when and how to get tested.

      Workplace protections
     </h2>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, all employees (including casual employees) are protected from adverse action because they have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a workplace right, or
      </li>
      <li>
       they have exercised or proposed to exercise their workplace right.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      ‘Workplace rights’ include obligations that an employee has under WHS laws, which may include obligations under public health orders. For example, a
      <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="f49459a1-270e-4fcb-aa32-75488887fafc" href="/taxonomy/term/768" title="Public health order">
       public health order
      </a>
      may require an employee not to attend the workplace for a certain period of time following a positive rapid antigen or PCR test.
     </p>
     <p>
      It’s unlawful for an employer to take or threaten to take adverse action (for example, firing or injuring an employee in their employment) because of an employee’s workplace rights. Find out more about

      An employee who has been lawfully required to take a COVID-19 test can be asked to show their employer evidence of the test result.
     </p>
     <p>
      For employers covered by the Privacy Act 1988, they can only collect (record or keep a copy of) the rapid antigen test results if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee gives informed consent (involving no threat of disciplinary action or dismissal) and the collection is reasonably necessary for the business’s functions or activities, or
      </li>
      <li>
       collection is authorised by law (for example, a public health order requires the information to be collected or where collection is necessary for the employer to meet their WHS obligations).
      </li>
     </ul>
