      Summary
     </h2>
     <p>
      Some employees can request flexible working arrangements. Employees need to have worked for the same employer for at least 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Examples of flexible working arrangements include changes to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       hours of work – for example, changes to start and finish times
      </li>
      <li>
       patterns of work – for example, split shifts or job sharing
      </li>
      <li>
       locations of work – for example, working from home.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employees need to follow certain rules when requesting flexible working arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers need to follow certain rules when responding to these requests.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a dispute about these requests can’t be resolved at the workplace, the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) can help.

      What employers should do with a request
     </h2>
     <h3>
      Responding to a request
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employers who get a request from an employee for flexible working arrangements need to respond in writing within 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The response has to include whether the request is approved or refused. There are rules for refusing a request – see below for details.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees can agree to working arrangements that are different from what the employee had originally requested. Where this happens, the employer needs to confirm the agreed changes in writing within 21 days of getting the employee’s request.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Refusing a request
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employer can only refuse a request on reasonable business grounds and if they have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       discussed the request with the employee and genuinely tried to reach an agreement on alternative arrangements to accommodate the employee’s circumstances
      </li>
      <li>
       considered the consequences for refusing the employee’s request.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Reasonable business grounds
     </h3>
     <p>
      Reasonable business grounds can include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the requested arrangements are too costly
      </li>
      <li>
       other employees’ working arrangements can’t be changed to accommodate the request
      </li>
      <li>
       it would be impractical to change other employees’ working arrangements or hire new employees to accommodate the request
      </li>
      <li>
       the request:
       <ul>
        <li>
         is likely to result in a significant loss in efficiency or productivity, or
        </li>
        <li>
         would have a significant negative impact on customer service.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The employer’s circumstances can be factored in when considering if the employer has reasonable business grounds for refusing a request. For example, the employer’s size and nature of the business.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Writing a refusal response
     </h3>
     <p>
      When an employer refuses a request, the written response needs to include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the reasons for the refusal including an explanation of the grounds for refusing and how they apply to the request
      </li>
      <li>
       other changes the employer is willing to make or a statement that there aren’t any changes to be made
      </li>
      <li>
       information about getting help from the Fair Work Commission for disputes about flexible working arrangements.

      Lodging a dispute with the Commission
     </h2>
     <p>
      If the employer and employee can’t resolve a dispute about flexible working arrangements, they can apply to the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) for help.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission can hear disputes about flexible working arrangement requests and make orders to resolve disputes. This includes if the employer:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       refuses an employee’s request
      </li>
      <li>
       doesn’t respond to a request within 21 days.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Commission will usually attempt to resolve the dispute using conciliation or mediation first. This is a less formal process involving discussions between an employer and employee to resolve the dispute.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there isn’t a resolution, the Commission can arbitrate the dispute. This is a more formal process where employers and employees can present evidence and arguments. The Commission makes binding orders that employees and employers need to comply with.
