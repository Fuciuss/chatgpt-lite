      We continue to focus on matters that:

      Compliance and enforcement priorities
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s purpose is to promote harmonious, productive, cooperative and compliant workplace relations in Australia. Our functions include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       providing advice and assistance
      </li>
      <li>
       promoting and monitoring compliance with workplace laws
      </li>
      <li>
       investigating breaches of the law
      </li>
      <li>
       taking appropriate enforcement action.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We perform these functions in a variety of ways, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       undertaking targeted proactive compliance and education work
      </li>
      <li>
       responding to requests for assistance, emerging issues reported through the media (or other external sources) and self-reported non-compliance
      </li>
      <li>
       implementing new funding measures.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      There is an element of discretion in how we allocate resources to undertake our proactive and responsive activities. Our annual Compliance and Enforcement Priorities provides a framework through which we prioritise this resource allocation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our Compliance and Enforcement Priorities focus on industries that are at significant risk of non-compliance and emerging issues that are of considerable public interest and concern. We also prioritise cohorts who, for a variety of reasons, are identified as requiring additional assistance or are vulnerable.
