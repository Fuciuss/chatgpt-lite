      <strong>
       26 March 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Dozens of underpaid workers in
       <strong>
        Darwin
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Alice Springs
       </strong>
       have been back-paid more than $94,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The biggest recovery was $38,800 for 16 trainees at a
       <strong>
        Darwin
       </strong>
       business who did not receive their night-shift penalty rates for three years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employer mistakenly believed that only qualified workers, and not trainees, were entitled to night-shift penalty rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business co-operated with Fair Work inspectors and promptly reimbursed all money owed once the error was identified.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “When we find mistakes, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure future compliance,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the case highlights the importance of Top End employers taking the time to ensure they understand their obligations to their employees under workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “A small mistake left over time can easily result in a hefty bill for back-payment of wages – so it is important employers get it right in the first place,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Other recent recoveries include:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        $13,000 for 26 workers at an
        <strong>
         Alice Springs
        </strong>
        caravan park, including front office, reception and cleaning staff, who were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and weekend penalty rates over a 12-month period in 2013-2014
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $11,800 for 10 shop assistants at a
        <strong>
         Darwin
        </strong>
        sandwich bar who were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and weekend penalty rates over 12-months in 2013-2014
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $9000 for two shop assistants at a
        <strong>
         Darwin
        </strong>
        retail shop who were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and overtime entitlements, and not paid for all hours worked over a five-month period last year
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $8800 for 12 waiters and waitresses at an
        <strong>
         Alice Springs
        </strong>
        restaurant underpaid their casual loadings, weekend and late-night penalty rates for three months in 2013
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $7700 for 68 workers, many of whom worked in guest services positions, at an
        <strong>
         Alice Springs
        </strong>
        hotel who were underpaid their weekend and public holiday penalty rates and allowances over a 12-month period in 2013-2014, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $5000 for eight kitchen and counter staff at an
        <strong>
         Alice Springs
        </strong>
        café, including a number of overseas workers, who were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and weekend penalty rates over a 12-month period in 2013-2014.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       In all cases, the employees were reimbursed in full without the need for further action after Fair Work inspectors contacted the businesses and explained their obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We’re confident these underpayments were genuine mistakes and it was pleasing to see the employers correct the errors and put processes in place to ensure they aren’t repeated,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Last financial year the Fair Work Ombudsman resolved more than 25,000 requests for assistance from employees who believed they had been underpaid or treated unfairly.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       More than $23 million was recovered for over 15,000 underpaid workers nationally.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the overwhelming majority of employers want to do the right thing by their employees and get it right when it comes to workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We find that most mistakes are due to a lack of awareness of workplace laws, rather than employers deliberately doing the wrong thing,” she said.
