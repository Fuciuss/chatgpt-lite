      An
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      car windscreens company and its director have been penalised almost $85,000 after exploiting seven employees, including one who was paid a flat hourly rate of just $12.50 for a period of 10 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Complete Windscreens (SA) Pty Ltd - which specialises in windscreen repairs, fitting and tinting - has been penalised $73,425 and its part-owner and sole director Lindsay Dean, of Adelaide, has been penalised a further $11,220.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties, imposed in the Federal Court, are the result of the Fair Work Ombudsman taking legal action in relation to seven Complete Windscreens employees being underpaid a total of $59,969 over a four-year period from 2007 to 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the penalties, the Court has ordered Complete Windscreens to back-pay the employees in full, plus pay superannuation owing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated the matter after the employees made underpayment allegations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found that one of the employees had been paid just $12.50 an hour for a period of 10 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other employees, including three young workers aged between 18 and 20 at the time, were paid flat rates ranging from $12 to $21.62.
     </p>
     <p>
      This resulted in the employees variously being underpaid their minimum hourly rates, casual loadings and penalty rates for weekend and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meal allowances and leave entitlements were also underpaid and record-keeping and pay slip laws were contravened.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments of the seven employees ranged from $1308 to $17,990.
     </p>
     <p>
      Justice Anthony Besanko found that some of the conduct involved “an element of exploitation”, describing some contraventions as “deliberate, or at the very least reckless”.
     </p>
     <p>
      Justice Besanko found that Complete Windscreens and Dean must have known that the employee paid the lowest flat rate was being underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      “His hourly rate was considerably lower than other employees who were both younger and less experienced,” Justice Besanko said in his judgment.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(He) was paid $12.50 per hour over 10 years and nearly every other employee was earning more than him, including the trainees with no experience.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Justice Besanko rejected the company’s argument that, as a family business, it was not as culpable as a large organisation with dedicated human resources and accounting advisers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Justice Besanko found Complete Windscreens made “no or no adequate enquiries about the pay and conditions of the employees” despite being a member of the Motor Traders Association of South Australia and having access to industrial advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the penalties should serve as a warning that blatantly underpaying workers’ minimum Award entitlements is serious conduct that will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The size and blatant nature of the underpayments and the involvement of young workers were important factors in our decision to pursue this matter in Court,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is simply not good enough for a business to pay flat hourly rates that significantly undercut minimum Award entitlements.”
