      <strong>
       11 August 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against No Land Tax Campaign Inc.  - better known as the No Land Tax Party - and its leader Peter Jones.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has received almost 1000 requests for assistance from workers claiming they have not been paid wages promised to them for handing out how-to-vote cards for the No Land Tax Party (NLTP) in NSW in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NLTP and Mr Jones allegedly promised to pay workers $30 an hour to hand out how-to-vote cards on NSW state election day, but paid them nothing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency’s number one priority was to try to ensure the many people who worked for the NLTP received their full entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We made every effort to resolve this matter with Mr Jones without the need for legal action, but unfortunately his lack of co-operation made that impossible,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Jones did not rectify the alleged underpayments and allegedly failed to comply with a Notice to Produce records.
     </p>
     <p>
      He also declined to participate in a record of interview with Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says an ongoing lack of co-operation left the Agency with no option but to commence legal proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter will be heard in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is possible that up to 3600 workers may be affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Court documents allege the NLTP mailed flyers to homes around NSW earlier this year seeking “
      <em>
       outgoing and enthusiastic
      </em>
      ” people to hand out how-to-vote cards from 7am to 6pm on NSW election day, March 28.
     </p>
     <p>
      The flyer allegedly stated: “
      <em>
       Your base pay is $30 an hour – you will get paid this regardless of what vote your local candidate obtains …
      </em>
      ”
     </p>
     <p>
      Additional bonuses up to $500 were also allegedly offered if candidates polled well.
     </p>
     <p>
      After workers registered online, they were allegedly deployed to various polling booths around NSW where the NLTP fielded candidates, and generally worked shifts of between nine and 10 hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking penalties against Mr Jones and the NLTP in relation to four alleged contraventions of the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Jones faces maximum potential penalties of between $5100 and $10,200 per contravention and the NLTP faces maximum penalties between $25,500 and $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking injunctions restraining both the NLTP and Mr Jones from underpaying any workers in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Fair Work Ombudsman is successful with the injunction, Mr Jones and the NLTP could potentially face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayments proven in Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      For practical reasons, the Fair Work Ombudsman is only able to commence legal proceedings in relation to a small number of workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not clear if the NLTP has sufficient assets to enable any back-payment orders secured in Court to be effectively enforced.
     </p>
     <p>
      “However, it is important we send a message to the community that failing to pay workers for work performed is very serious conduct that will not be allowed to go unpunished,” Ms James concluded.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has taken legal action in relation to 21 workers – including teenagers, one as young as 14 - who were allegedly not paid a total of $6155 they were entitled to for handing out how-to-vote cards.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency has requested Court Orders requiring the NLTP to back-pay the 21 named workers and provide a report to the Fair Work Ombudsman listing the names and hours worked by all other workers engaged on election day.
