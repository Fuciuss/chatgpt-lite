      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s proactive compliance and education campaign in
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      has found that 54 per cent of audited businesses were non-compliant with their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors checked the time-and-wage records of 54 businesses across Darwin city and suburbs including
      <strong>
       Parap, Larrakeyah
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Winnellie
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign was commenced in response to higher numbers of requests for assistance from these suburbs in the years preceding the audits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, 29 businesses audited during the campaign were found to have committed at least one workplace breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      Twenty-five businesses (46 per cent) were not paying their employees correctly, while 16 (30 per cent) were not meeting their record-keeping and pay slip obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result of the audits, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered a total of $20,722 in owed wages and entitlements on behalf of 44 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that it is imperative that employers make themselves aware of their workplace obligations and put in place processes to ensure compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “While I am pleased to find there was no evidence of deliberate non-compliance, we are continuing to see too many businesses getting the basics wrong when it comes to their workplace obligations,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “My agency has a wealth of free information and resources to assist employers to navigate and understand workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I urge businesses to make use of these resources to ensure they are doing the right thing by their workers and avoid any difficulties down the track.”
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to the breaches, Fair Work inspectors issued one formal caution, one compliance notice and four infringement notices (on-the-spot fines).
     </p>
     <p>
      In one matter, a Darwin café was found to have underpaid three employees a total of $4988 over a 10-month period after incorrectly paying the employees at the introductory rate under the Restaurant Industry Award 2010 for longer than the maximum three-month period. The employer also failed to pay weekend penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer stated that they had misinterpreted the classification descriptions under the award. The employer was issued with a compliance notice and back-paid the workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Darwin report follows the

       release earlier this year
      </a>
      of the findings of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s campaign in Alice Springs and Barkly, which found 39 per cent of audited businesses to be non-compliant with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James warns that non-compliant businesses were now on notice and could face serious enforcement action for future breaches.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers should be aware that penalties for serious contraventions of workplace laws, as well as those for record-keeping breaches, have recently increased,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “In April we also launched our
      <a href="https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/news-and-media-releases/2018-media-releases/april-2018/20180411-workplace-basics-campaign-mr">
       Workplace Basics campaign
      </a>
      aimed at assisting businesses to access and navigate the wide range of free resources available to help them meet their obligations to pay workers correctly and follow record-keeping and pay-slip laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are happy to work with any business that requires our assistance to ensure they are complying with workplace laws.”
