      Child play centres in the

      and
      <strong>
       Central Coast
      </strong>
      regions of

       NSW
      </strong>
      need to pay greater attention to their wage rates, according to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Random audits of six centres have found that all but one were underpaying their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors assessed their employment records after receiving information about the potential underpayment of minimum entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      They subsequently determined that 32 staff across five of the six centres had been underpaid a total of almost $10,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest underpayment was $2726 for three workers at a
      <strong>
       Newcastle
      </strong>
      centre who had been underpaid their minimum hourly rate and overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found a number of other issues across the five centres, including underpayment of weekend penalty rates, failure to develop written hours-of-work agreements for part-time employees and record-keeping and pay slip errors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The audits focused on centres providing out-of-school-hours and short-term child care.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most underpaid workers were employed in child care, play centre attendant and café positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James, who is visiting Newcastle today, says the results suggest that some employers are not paying enough attention to their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A lack of awareness of workplace laws can easily result in inadvertent underpayment of wages or other workplace entitlements, as has occurred here,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Ms James says it is pleasing that all centres have agreed to rectify the underpayments and have accepted assistance from inspectors to put processes in place to ensure ongoing compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It was also reassuring that the one business found to be fully compliant had previously been assisted by our inspectors to address non-compliance issues, which reinforces that most employers achieve compliance after interacting with us,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a particular focus on protecting the rights of young workers, some of whom may be unaware of their workplace rights or reluctant to complain.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Young workers can be vulnerable at work, so it’s important we are proactive about conducting audits in industries which tend to employ significant numbers of young people,” Ms James said.
     </p>
