     </p>
     <p>
      In a bid to raise awareness of record-keeping obligations, the Fair Work Ombudsman is planning site visits to 450 businesses throughout
      <strong>
       South Australia
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Western Australia
      </strong>
      and the
      <strong>
       Northern Territory
      </strong>
      over the next month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The face-to-face visits are aimed at educating employers about their responsibilities and how the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist them to comply with workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inadequate records hamper the ability of Fair Work inspectors to determine if employees are being paid correctly if a dispute arises over wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In the past, the Agency has taken legal action against some employers who did not keep proper records and who were suspected of underpaying their staff.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 2010, an Adelaide trolley collecting company and its director were fined $35,000 by the South Australian Industrial Relations Court and the operators of a Melbourne restaurant were penalised $10,000 in the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In both cases, the lack of records prohibited the Fair Work Ombudsman from determining whether large numbers of employees, suspected of being significantly underpaid, had received their full lawful entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>

       During the visits, Fair Work inspectors will hand out education packs with information about the free tools and resources available from the Fair Work Ombudsman to assist them.

       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
