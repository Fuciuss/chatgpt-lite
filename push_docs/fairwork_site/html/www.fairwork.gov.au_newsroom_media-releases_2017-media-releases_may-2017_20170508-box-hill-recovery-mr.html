      The Fair Work Ombudsman has assisted a former employee of a seafood processing business in Box Hill, Victoria to recover $85,000 in unpaid entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker, who was a general hand assisting in the loading and unloading of stock, was paid just $9 to $11.50 during 16 years of employment at the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      He worked at the business an average of 22 to 35 hours per week.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer told the Fair Work Ombudsman that the employee received a lower rate of pay because they believed the employee had a reduced capacity to carry out tasks and had hired the employee out of compassion.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee should have been paid according to the
      <em>
       General Retail Industry Award 2010
      </em>
      for the duration of his employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Currently, Level 1 retail employees are entitled to receive $730.80 per week, or $19.44 per hour.  The rate increases to $24.30 for evening work and Saturday work, $38.88 for Sunday work and $48.60 for public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Representatives from the Fair Work Ombudsman contacted the employer after receiving a request for assistance from the employee and assisted the parties to resolve the matter, without need for enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer was educated about their obligations under the Fair Work Act.  They co-operated with the Agency and promptly rectified the matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business avoided enforcement action because it co-operated with the Fair Work Ombudsman, agreed that it had breached its obligations and did not have any history of non-compliance before this matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the error was inadvertent and was the result of the employer failing to check their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      "When we find errors our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure mistakes are not repeated," Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s website has a range of tools and resources to assist business owners to understand and comply with their obligations, including the Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT).
