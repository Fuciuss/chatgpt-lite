      The Fair Work Ombudsman will audit at least 200 businesses across outer west Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Wollondilly in its latest proactive compliance and education campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Targeted areas include Penrith, Springwood, Picton and Katoomba.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is targeting regional hotspots of non-compliance, with the outer west Sydney and Blue Mountains region reporting high numbers of young workers in workplace disputes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wollondilly accounts for the highest number per 1,000 businesses of anonymous reports received by the Fair Work Ombudsman in New South Wales, and ranks second highest in terms of requests for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors will be checking businesses’ time and wage records for compliance with workplace laws. Audits will cover a cross-section of industries, including but not limited to construction, retail, manufacturing and accommodation and food services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said that young workers are vulnerable to underpayment and poor working conditions due to their lack of experience and awareness of rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Proactive campaigns are an important tool to educate employers about their workplace obligations. Inspectors will provide advice to businesses to help them comply with the law,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Businesses should be warned that non-compliance can lead to action ranging from formal cautions and on-the-spot fines to litigation for the most serious breaches.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “As in all our campaigns, we are keen to work closely with key stakeholders in the region in building a culture of compliance,” Ms Parker said.
