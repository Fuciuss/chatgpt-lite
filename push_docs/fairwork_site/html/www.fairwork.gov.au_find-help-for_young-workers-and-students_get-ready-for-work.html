      What is an award?
     </h3>
     <p>
      An award is a legal document that sets out the minimum pay rates and employment conditions. There are different awards for different types of industries and occupations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Awards also include job classifications that explain what level an employee is working at, depending on the type of duties they perform. Knowing your job classification will help you understand what you should be paid. Find more information on our

       Ali is 16 and just got a job as a barista in a café. Her older sister, Melanie, works as a barista for a catering company. Melanie gets her pay rates and work entitlements from the Hospitality Award, and Ali assumes that she will too. However, Ali’s new employer tells her she’ll be covered by the Restaurant Award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ali checks the Restaurant Award online. She finds the coverage clause and sees that the award covers employers in the restaurant industry, which includes cafés, and their employees who fall within certain classifications. She also checks the classification list and sees the work she will do as a barista is covered there. She also goes to our website and uses our

       Bridget works in a clothing store. As part of her duties, she opens and closes the store and supervises junior sales assistants.

       Bridget’s employer pays Bridget as a Level 2 employee under the Retail Award. However, Bridget reads the classification descriptions in the award and notices that some of the duties she performs are listed under Level 3. She also looks at the

       Bridget shows the award to her employer, who agrees to pay her as a Level 3 retail employee. This is because Bridget works at a higher level than a Level 2 employee, and she’s required to provide supervisory assistance to the shop manager, as well as open and close the store.

      What is a registered agreement?
     </h3>
     <p>
      A registered agreement is a document between an employer and their employees about employment conditions. An agreement must be approved by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      An agreement will generally override any award that would otherwise apply, but it still needs to meet the base pay rates in the award.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can ask your employer if you are covered by an enterprise agreement or other registered agreement. You can also search for an agreement on the

      What are the National Employment Standards?
     </h3>
     <p>
      As an employee, you’re entitled to minimum workplace rights, including the National Employment Standards (NES) and minimum wage. These are compulsory entitlements that your employer must give you.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NES covers things like:
     </p>
     <ul>

      </li>
      <li>
       different types of leave

      <li>
       public holidays
      </li>
      <li>
       requirements for notice if your employment ends.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These entitlements will vary depending on whether you’re a full-time, part-time or casual employee.
     </p>
