     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has secured a total of $16,300 back-pay for five overseas workers at a labour hire company based at
      <strong>
       Fremantle
      </strong>
      , in Western Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The labour hire company supplied the employees to work at a food processing factory in Perth, where their duties involved cutting, peeling, washing and packing vegetables.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company paid the workers a flat hourly rate of less than $22 for all hours worked, which was insufficient to meet the penalty rates they were entitled to for weekend and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      As casual employees, under the
      <em>
       Food, Beverage and Tobacco Manufacturing Award
      </em>
      they were entitled to receive up to $32.54 on Saturdays, $43.38 on Sundays and $43.38 for overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were all visa-holders from non-English speaking backgrounds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors conducted inquiries into the matter after the workers sought assistance, concerned they were not receiving all of their entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      After inspectors contacted the labour hire company and explained its obligations under workplace laws, the company rectified the underpayments in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the company avoided enforcement action by fully co-operating and agreeing to take steps to ensure it complies in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors issued the employer with a formal Letter of Caution placing it on notice that further breaches could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We treat underpayment of overseas workers particularly seriously because they can be vulnerable if they are unaware of their rights or reluctant to complain,” Ms James said.
     </p>

      Other recent Fair Work Ombudsman recoveries in Perth include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $8300 for a traffic controller in
       <strong>
        Perth
       </strong>
       who was underpaid his relevant minimum hourly rate for nearly two years, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $7200 for a casual mining industry worker based in
       <strong>
        Perth
       </strong>
       who was owed wages by his labour hire employer after he was short-changed due to an internal communication error.
      </li>
     </ul>
