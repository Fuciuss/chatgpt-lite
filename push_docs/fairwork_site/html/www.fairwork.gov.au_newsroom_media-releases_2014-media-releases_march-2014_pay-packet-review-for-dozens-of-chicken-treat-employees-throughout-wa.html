      <strong>
       16 March 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of former and current employees of Chicken Treat outlets in Western Australia will have their pay packets reviewed to ensure they are receiving their full entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Australian Fast Foods Pty Ltd, which owns and operates the Chicken Treat brand, has agreed to self-audit its records to check wages, overtime and allowances.
     </p>
     <p>
      The audits will apply to three full pay periods for a mix of full-time, part-time, casual, adult and junior employees who worked in Chicken Treat stores between 2010 and 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      Australian Fast Foods has agreed to voluntarily reimburse any outstanding entitlements it may uncover, and report on its findings to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Australian Fast Foods Pty Ltd, which trades as Chicken Treat and employs about 500 people, has entered into a Proactive Compliance Deed (PCD) with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Deed is being actioned following a targeted campaign by the Fair Work Ombudsman last year to assess enterprise agreements in Western Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the campaign, Fair Work inspectors audited a number of Chicken Treat stores owned and operated by Australian Fast Foods.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some cases, the company was paying its staff under the Chicken Treat Employees, SDA Agreement 2009 at rates less than stipulated in the Fast Food Industry Award 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once this was identified, about 450 employees were immediately back-paid more than $35,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Australian Fast Foods has agreed to work in collaboration with the Fair Work Ombudsman to ensure that there have been no further underpayments under the 2009 Agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it does find additional contraventions for the period 2010-2012, the company has agreed to conduct a second round of audits for the period up to June, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first review is to be concluded by the end of June and if a second is required, by the end of December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, an employee liaison officer is to be appointed to deal specifically with any new complaints from workers about their entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has agreed to refer any new complaints it receives to the company for self-resolution, but reserves the right to investigate matters considered to be serious or in the public interest for it to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Australian Fast Foods is required to provide a written report after 12 months detailing the number of complaints, time taken to resolve and the amount of any underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James today welcomed the company's pro-active approach, saying it showed corporate responsibility to a large number of employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is heartening to see companies which recognise the importance of great relationships with staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Proactive Compliance Deeds facilitate better communication between employers and employees, as well as strengthening the co-operation and working arrangements between employers and ourselves," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The Deeds are a valuable way for us to engage with employers who want to do the right thing and we commend Australian Fast Foods for taking the extra step of joining up.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This Deed is an example of how the Fair Work Ombudsman continues to look for ways to assist employers and employees to be able to self-resolve issues in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The program is a terrific model for other companies who want to be seen as a great place to work."
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of the Deed is available at www.fairwork.gov.au
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also runs a National Franchise Program (NFP) to encourage big franchisors to enhance their brand by publicly supporting fair workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said those participating in the NFP receive free resources to educate their franchisees and advice on how to best promote compliance with workplace laws across their network.
     </p>
     <p>
      "They are demonstrating their commitment to corporate responsibility and sending out a message that they value the rights of their large and diverse workforces," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are also a range of tools and resources for small business people available on the Fair Work Ombudsman's website at
      <a href="/find-help-for/small-business/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/smallbusiness
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Free template documentation is available for employers to use when hiring, managing and dismissing staff, including letters of engagement and probation, timesheet and pay slip templates, leave application forms and a self-audit check list.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website also has a number of dedicated tools and resources, including PayCheck Plus and an Award Finder, to assist business owners to calculate the correct pay for their employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      A series of Best Practice Guides is available on a range of topics, including 'small business and the Fair Work Act'.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said providing advice to time-poor small businesses with minimal workplace relations support or expertise is a high priority for the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Small business is entitled to credible and reliable information about their obligations in a way that makes sense to them, and via channels that they can access quickly and easily," she said.
