       An
       <strong>
        Adelaide
       </strong>
       labour hire company short-changed an Indian visa-holder $22,000 over just 17 months, inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The business underpaid the casual employee’s minimum hourly and public holiday rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It also failed to pay his casual loading, which alone totalled $19,085.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee, aged in his mid-30s, was working six days a week in the horticulture industry on a 475 skilled regional sponsored visa.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He was paid flat rates of between $15.96 and $17 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under the
       <em>
        Horticulture Industry Award
       </em>
       he should have received a minimum of between $20.66 and $20.83 an hour and between $26.45 and $29.99 on public holidays.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee sought the assistance of the Fair Work Ombudsman after he was unsuccessful in attempts to resolve the issue directly with his employer.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business escaped enforcement action because it had not previously come to the Agency’s attention and co-operated with inspectors to rectify the matter and ensure its ongoing compliance in the future.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, after a follow-up Compliance Notice was issued following further requests for assistance from two other employees, the company went into liquidation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In separate matters, the Fair Work Ombudsman has recently recovered:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        $18,000 for 26 casual wait staff at an
        <strong>
         Adelaide CBD
        </strong>
        restaurant who were paid a flat rate of $22 an hour when they should have received up to $27.71,
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $8500 for a male fast food worker in
        <strong>
         Mawson Lakes
        </strong>
        who completed unpaid work for a portion of his shifts, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $6000 for a full-time manager, three casual housekeepers and a receptionist at an accommodation business in
        <strong>
         Adelaide’s CBD
        </strong>
        who were underpaid their minimum hourly rate and weekend penalties.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
