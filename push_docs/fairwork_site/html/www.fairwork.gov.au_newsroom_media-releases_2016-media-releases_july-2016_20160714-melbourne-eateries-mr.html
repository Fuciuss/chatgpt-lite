      The operator of a dozen restaurants across Melbourne has been required to back-pay almost 250 workers after inadvertently underpaying their Christmas Day entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 246 employees have been reimbursed a total of $21,700 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest individual underpayment was $181.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the restaurant operator mistakenly believed it could declare Christmas Day a “shut-down”, rather than paying its permanent employees for a day off for a public holiday.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees are employed at restaurants located in
      <strong>

      <strong>

      Ms James says Fair Work inspectors believe the employer made a genuine error and it has therefore avoided enforcement action after co-operating with the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, she says the case study highlights the importance of employers taking the necessary steps to ensure they understand the wage rates applicable to their employees, including penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It's important that employers who are unsure about their obligations contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for advice and information," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Our website can assist employers and workers alike understand and comply with their rights and obligations so there aren't any issues arising around public holidays."
     </p>
     <p>
      Information available in the
      <a href="http://www.fairwork.gov.au/publicholidays">
       Public holidays section
      </a>
      includes an overview of the workplace laws that apply on public holidays, including what employers need to pay and what employees are entitled to.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees and employers can use the Fair Work Ombudsman’s free online tools and resources to check entitlements specific to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency’s Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements. Visit

     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says most underpayments are inadvertent and the result of employers failing to check their minimum obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      "When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2014-15, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered $5.9 million in underpaid wages and entitlements for 4070 employees in Melbourne.
     </p>
