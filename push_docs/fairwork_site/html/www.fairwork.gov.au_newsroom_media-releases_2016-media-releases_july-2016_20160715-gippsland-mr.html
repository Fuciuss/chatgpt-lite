      <strong>
       15 July 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Two employees at a
      <strong>
       Traralgon
      </strong>
      eatery have been back-paid $7700 after the Fair Work Ombudsman found the business had short-changed them.
     </p>
     <p>
      A female casual waitress was paid lower part-time rates and underpaid her Saturday and Sunday penalty rates for 17 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The young worker was paid a minimum of up to $17.35 an hour on weekdays, $21.65 on Saturdays and $26.03 on Sundays when she should have received up to $23.09 on weekdays and $27.71 at weekends.
     </p>
     <p>
      A full-time junior apprentice chef did not receive his tool allowance and was paid a flat rate of $10.80 an hour for three months, but should have received a minimum of $11.07 and up $16.20 at weekends.
     </p>
     <p>
      He was also not paid his annual leave and annual leave loading upon termination.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer told Fair Work inspectors the underpayments were inadvertent and the business had since introduced procedures to prevent ongoing errors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer also failed to pass on the annual federal wage increase and only issued pay-slips to employees upon request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that while the employer has corrected its mistakes, the business has received a formal Letter of Caution placing it on notice that further contraventions of workplace law could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “When we find mistakes, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the errors are not repeated,” she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, a
      <strong>
       Maffra
      </strong>
      employer back-paid a worker almost $6200 in outstanding pro-rata long service leave that was payable when the employee retired.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says both cases highlight the importance of Gippsland employers ensuring they understand their lawful workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers must undertake their own checks of award provisions and do periodical checks to ensure compliance,” she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Award, as well as classification and pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates.”
