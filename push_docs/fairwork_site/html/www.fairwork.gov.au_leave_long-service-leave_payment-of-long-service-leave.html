      Payment of long service leave at the end of employment
     </h2>
     <p>
      Any unused long service leave has to be paid out at the end of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Long service leave usually can't be cashed out while the employee is still working for the business.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Payment of pro-rata long service leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      When employment ends before an employee has worked the total number of years needed to get the full long service leave entitlement, they can sometimes get paid out part of their long service leave. This is known as pro-rata long service leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether an employee gets paid out pro-rata long service leave when their employment ends depends on the long service laws in the state or territory they work in.
