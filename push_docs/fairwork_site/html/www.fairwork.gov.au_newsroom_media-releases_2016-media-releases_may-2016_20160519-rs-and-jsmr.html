      <strong>

     <p>
      The former operator of an Indian restaurant at
      <strong>
       Richmond
      </strong>
      , in suburban Melbourne, is facing Court for allegedly failing to respond to a request to back-pay thousands of dollars to two former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against RS &amp; JS Pty Ltd, which previously owned and operated Konna Indian Cuisine, later renamed Punjabi Tandoori Corner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court is former company director Hari Pal.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that two Indian national visa-holders studying in Australia were short-changed a total of more than $8000 for work they performed at the restaurant between October, 2014 and January last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged the two females were paid a flat rate of $12 an hour for waiting on tables and did not receive penalties when working on weekends, nights and public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were allegedly short-changed $5395 and $2687.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice to RS &amp; JS Pty Ltd in October last year requiring the underpayment to be rectified, but it was not.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the alleged underpayment was significant given it accumulated over such a short timeframe.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says the employer's failure to respond to the Compliance Notice and the involvement of vulnerable overseas workers were factors in the Agency's decision to litigate.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We will always look to work with employers to resolve issues co-operatively and voluntarily where we can, but we take a dim view of employers who do not engage with us and deliberately ignore us and their workplace obligations," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      RS &amp; JS Pty Ltd faces a penalty up to $27,000, while Mr Pal faces a penalty of up to $5400.
