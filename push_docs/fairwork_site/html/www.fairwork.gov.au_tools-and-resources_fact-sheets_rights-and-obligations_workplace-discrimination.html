      What is adverse action?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Adverse action is unlawful if it is taken for a discriminatory reason. The FW Act describes a number of adverse actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adverse action taken by an employer includes doing, threatening, or organising any of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       dismissing an employee
      </li>
      <li>
       injuring an employee in their employment
      </li>
      <li>
       altering an employee’s position to their detriment
      </li>
      <li>
       discriminating between one employee and other employees
      </li>
      <li>
       refusing to employ a prospective employee
      </li>
      <li>
       discriminating against a prospective employee on the terms and conditions in the offer of employment.
      </li>
     </ul>

        Example
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sally is employed at an advertising firm. Recently, Sally applied for a promotion for a vacant Account Manager position. During the interview, Sally mentions to the Manager that she is pregnant and plans on taking her entitlement to parental leave. Although Sally is highly qualified for the job, her Manager tells her that she did not receive the promotion because she would be taking her parental leave. Denying Sally this position because she is pregnant is prohibited under the FW Act.

      Employees and prospective employees in the Fair Work System. It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee. This includes full-time, part-time and casual employees, probationary employees, apprentices and trainees, and individuals employed for fixed periods of time or tasks.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also unlawful to refuse to hire a prospective employee based on one of the attributes listed above.

      What is not considered unlawful discrimination?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Treating someone differently is not necessarily unlawful discrimination. Some different treatment such as general performance management may not be an unlawful discrimination issue. Under the FW Act, an action is only considered adverse action if it occurs due to one or more of the protected attributes (race, sex, age, disability, etc). If this is not the basis of the action, it may not be considered an act of unlawful discrimination.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight">
      <p>
       <strong>
        Example
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul is a marketing employee who made several errors on his last project. To try and address this, Paul has been placed on a performance management plan to develop his skills. However Paul continued to make errors while on the plan. As such, Paul’s daily duties have been changed while he was undergoing further training. In this example, it is not unlawful to alter Paul’s employment because the reason was not based on his personal attributes (race, sex, age, disability, etc).
      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      The FW Act also provides that in some circumstances, an action may not be considered discrimination.
     </p>
     <p>
      This includes where the action:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is permissible under Commonwealth, state or territory anti-discrimination laws
      </li>
      <li>
       is based on the inherent requirements of the particular position concerned
      </li>
      <li>
       is taken against a staff member of an institution run in accordance with religious beliefs, and the action is taken in good faith and to avoid injury to those religious beliefs.

      Everyone has the right to a workplace free from bullying. Bullying at work happens when:

     <ul>
      <li>
       a person or group of people repeatedly behave unreasonably towards another worker or group of workers
      </li>

      What about sexual harassment?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Everyone has the right to a workplace that is safe and free from sexual harassment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sexual harassment is:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an unwelcome sexual advance or request for sexual favours to the person who is harassed
      </li>
      <li>
       other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person who is harassed.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The FW Act prohibits sexual harassment connected to work, including in the workplace. This means workers, future workers and other people conducting a business or undertaking (such as self-employed people or sole traders) are protected from sexual harassment in connection to work.

      The FWO is committed to ensuring that employees and prospective employees are protected from unlawful workplace discrimination and any other adverse actions by an employer. Where an investigation finds that the employer has (or had) discriminatory practices that are linked to adverse actions for employees or prospective employees, the FWO may take enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you believe that you and/or other employees have been unlawfully discriminated against in your employment, you can request assistance from the FWO. You can do this by submitting an

      <a class="external-link" href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/">

     <p>
      Under the general protections in the FW Act, there are a number of remedies and penalties for adverse action on discriminatory grounds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the Federal Court or Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia determines that a person has contravened the discrimination protections under the FW Act, the court may make any order that it considers appropriate, including orders for injunctions, reinstatement and/or compensation.
     </p>

      A court can also impose penalties for these contraventions.
