       Best practice tip
      </h3>
      <p>
       Employers should keep records of hours worked for all employees, including pieceworkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adopting best practice record-keeping makes it easier to keep track of employee details, identify payroll mistakes and keeps a business running efficiently. It also helps avoid fines for doing the wrong thing.

      What records have to be kept and what needs to be in them?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Certain information needs to be kept for each employee. If an employee is paid an annual wage under an award, employers are required to keep extra records for these employees. See
      <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d9b37440-6dfb-47c0-a7c6-899d766d11e3" href="/pay-and-wages/minimum-wages/annualised-salaries" title="Annualised salaries ">

     </p>
     <p>
      Here is a list of the records that an employer has to keep and what information has to be in the record.
     </p>
     <h3>
      General
     </h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employer’s and employee’s name
      </li>
      <li>
       employer’s ABN (if any)
      </li>
      <li>
       employee’s commencement date

      <li>
       whether the employee is full-time, part time, or casual
      </li>
      <li>
       whether the employee is permanent or temporary.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Pay
     </h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pay rate paid to the employee
      </li>
      <li>
       gross and net amounts paid
      </li>
      <li>
       any deductions from the gross amount
      </li>
      <li>
       details of any incentive-based payment, bonus, loading, penalty rate, or other monetary allowance or separately identifiable entitlement paid.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Hours of work
     </h3>
     <ul>
      <li>

       <ul>
        <li>
         the number of overtime hours worked by an employee during the day
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="_TELERIK_InsertParagraph">
          when the employee started and finished the overtime hours
         </span>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       the hours an employee works if the employee is a casual or irregular part-time employee who is paid based on time worked
      </li>
      <li>
       a copy of the written agreement if an employer and employee have agreed to an averaging of the employee’s work hours.

     </ul>
     <h3>
      Leave
     </h3>
     <ul>

      </li>

      </li>
     </ul>

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If employers pay a defined benefit interest into a

      </li>
      <li>
       the name of the person who terminated the employment.

     </ul>
     <h3>
      Transfer of business
     </h3>
     <p>
      Where there has been a transfer of business, the old employer has to give the new employer records of any transferring employee. The new employer also has to ask for employment records from the old employer for any transferring employee who becomes an employee within three months of the sale.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Pieceworkers
     </h3>

      Who can access records?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employee records are private and confidential. Only the employer, payroll staff, the employee and authorised individuals, such as an accountant, can access the records.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee asks to see their records, an employer must make them available. This includes after an employee has ceased employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      FWIs can also ask for time and wage records to find out what an employee is entitled to and whether they have been paid correctly.

     <p>
