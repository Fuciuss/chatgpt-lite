      Who is covered by the Fair Work system
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Fair Work system (the national system) covers most Australian workplaces. Working out who is covered is important because we work with employers and employees who are covered by the national system.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some Fair Work system entitlements that will apply to employers and employees who aren't in the national system. See our Library article

     <p>
      Employers and employees who aren’t covered by the Fair Work system should contact the relevant state body or their internal human resources department for help.

      State public sector and local government employees are covered by the state system.

     <p>
      The following types of businesses aren't covered by the national system:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       sole traders
      </li>
      <li>
       partnerships

      <li>
       other unincorporated entities
      </li>
      <li>
       non-trading corporations.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      These types of businesses and their employees are covered by the state system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sometimes businesses operating as sole traders, partnerships, other unincorporated entities, non-trading corporations and state public sector employers have registered agreements in the national system. Employees covered by those agreements are within the national system.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, local government employers with registered agreements in the national system will be covered by the state system.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a business is run by a sole trader in Western Australia and changes to a company, it will move to the national system.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a business is run by a partnership in Western Australia, the partnership will usually qualify as a national system employer if one of the partners is:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a company
      </li>
      <li>
       engaged in sufficient trading or financial activities.
