      The operator of a number of massage parlours in Adelaide is facing Court for alleged serious contraventions of record-keeping and pay slip laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia against Ming Yuan Hu, who owns and operates a number of massage parlours in Adelaide, including the ‘No Name Massage’, ‘Sakura Massage’, ‘Asian Massage’ and ‘Ma’s Massage’ outlets on Hindley Street.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court are Mr Hu’s companies Wuyu Pty Ltd and 9
      <sup>
       th
      </sup>
      Sky Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that when the Fair Work Ombudsman attempted to audit Mr Hu’s companies last year, he responded by advising that the records requested by the Fair Work inspector were not kept and staff were not issued with pay slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Hu has previously been put on notice of the need to comply with record-keeping and pay slip obligations under the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman audited Mr Hu’s massage parlours last year as part of unannounced visits to 19 massage shops in
      <strong>
       Hobart
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      in response to concerns of non-compliance in the sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      The alleged record-keeping contraventions by Mr Hu’s companies prevented Fair Work inspectors from determining whether 16 employees at Mr Hu’s massage parlours were being paid their lawful minimum entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says record-keeping failures that are so basic that they prevent audits from being completed are treated particularly seriously.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Hu faces maximum penalties of up to $5,400 per contravention over five alleged contraventions of the Fair Work Act, while his companies each face penalties of up to $27,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      A penalty hearing is listed in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia on June 2.
