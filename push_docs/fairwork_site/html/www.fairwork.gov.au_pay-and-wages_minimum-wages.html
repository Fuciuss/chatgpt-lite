      For most employees, the minimum wage is set by the award that covers their industry or occupation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Awards cover many different industries and occupations so it's important to get it right.
     </p>
     <p>
      Use our Pay and Conditions Tool to calculate the minimum pay rates, penalties and allowances that apply for your award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minimum wage refers to the amount of pay before tax is taken out (gross pay). For information about tax, including PAYG withholding, visit the

      The National Minimum Wage
     </h2>
     <p>
      The National Minimum Wage applies to employees not covered by an award or registered agreement. This is the minimum pay rate provided by the Fair Work Act 2009 and is reviewed each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      As of 1 July 2023 the National Minimum Wage is $23.23 per hour or $882.80 per week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees covered by an award or registered agreement are entitled to the minimum pay rates, including penalty rates and allowances in their award or agreement. These pay rates may be higher than the National Minimum Wage.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Minimum wage changes
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each year, the Fair Work Commission reviews both the National Minimum Wage and minimum pay rates under awards (Annual wage review). Most changes begin on the first full pay period on or after 1 July.
     </p>
     <p>

      Award wages less than the National Minimum Wage
     </h2>
     <p>
      As a result of the 2023 Annual Wage Review decision, some minimum award wages may now be less than the National Minimum Wage.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, some awards contain introductory pay rates for new employees in their industry. These rates generally apply for a limited time until an employee progresses to the next level.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you're covered by an award or agreement, the National Minimum Wage doesn’t apply.
