      <strong>
       4 May 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Coffee Club franchise has joined a growing list of businesses who want to work with the Fair Work Ombudsman in a compliance partnership.
     </p>
     <p>
      The franchise is one of a string of well-known brands which will pro-actively work with the Fair Work Ombudsman under a two-year agreement signed by the parent company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leading retail food franchisor Minor DKL Food Group Pty Ltd (MDKL) has made workplace compliance a high priority by signing the Proactive Compliance Deed (PCD).
     </p>
     <p>
      MDKL controls 350 workplaces throughout Australia with a 6000-strong workforce.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the franchisor and intellectual property owner of The Coffee Club, Ribs &amp; Rumps Restaurants, The Groove Train and Coffee Hit, with 410 restaurants in 11 countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      MDKL also owns Veneziano Coffee Roasters, a leading specialty coffee roasting house supplying wholesale and retail customers throughout Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James welcomed the MDKL partnership, noting that The Coffee Club previously participated in the Agency’s former National Employer Program.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the partnership, MDKL will:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Review its current systems and processes to ensure they promote compliance,
      </li>
      <li>
       Self-audit employment records to ensure employees are receiving their full entitlements,
       <strong>
       </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
       Nominate a dedicated staff member to deal with requests for assistance from its staff which are referred by the Fair Work Ombudsman, and
      </li>
      <li>
       Introduce workplace relations training for managers and ensure all employees are aware of their rights and entitlements.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will provide MDKL with a designated contact point within the Agency, give the company opportunity to resolve workplace issues in-house in the first instance without intervention and provide access to technical knowledge and training resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Agency is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia with the objective of supporting compliant, productive and inclusive workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Compliance partnerships are an initiative we have introduced for Australian companies who want to engage with us to demonstrate to their employees and the wider community that they take their workplace responsibilities seriously,” she said. “We welcome MDKL’s commitment and look forward to working with the company.”
     </p>
     <p>
      MDKL chief executive officer Jason Ball said the compliance partnership with the Fair Work Ombudsman reflected the Group’s commitment to best practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our people are an intrinsic part of our operations and this partnership ensures we continue to foster a culture of accountability,” Mr Ball said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other FWO partners include McDonalds, Domino’s, Red Rooster, Spotless, Bread Top, Asset Industries, Hays Specialist Recruitment, Australian Fast Foods, United Trolley Collections, Retail Zoo and JB HI-FI.
