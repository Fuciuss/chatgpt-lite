      A
      <strong>
       Fremantle
      </strong>
      restaurant has ended up with a hefty bill for back-payment of wages after it was found to be short-changing its waiting staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nineteen workers were underpaid almost $20,000 over 12 months, inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business was underpaying its employees their casual hourly rates, weekend and early-morning penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has co-operated with her Agency and willingly rectified the mistake.
     </p>
     <p>
      The restaurant has also worked with Fair Work inspectors to ensure it meets its obligations under workplace laws in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the finding illustrates that even a small wage error left over time can result in a major expense for a business that it was probably not budgeting for.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It highlights the importance of employers knowing exactly what wages and conditions apply to their workplace and keeping up to date,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter is one of a number finalised by the Fair Work Ombudsman in and around
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      recently, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $17,500 for an administrative assistant at a
       <strong>
        Malaga
       </strong>
       business who failed to receive her redundancy entitlements on termination,
      </li>
      <li>
       $16,800 for 20 cleaners at a
       <strong>
        Warwick
       </strong>
       business not paid for some hours worked and underpaid their broken shift allowances, overtime, weekend, late-night, morning and evening penalty rates,
      </li>
      <li>
       $10,500 for two young shop assistants at a
       <strong>
        Midland
       </strong>
       retail store underpaid their minimum hourly rates and weekend penalty rates, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $6700 for a paramedic employed by a
       <strong>
        Subiaco
       </strong>
       business for unpaid wages and annual leave entitlements on termination.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says all employers co-operated and reimbursed their staff without the need for the Fair Work Ombudsman to take enforcement action.
     </p>
