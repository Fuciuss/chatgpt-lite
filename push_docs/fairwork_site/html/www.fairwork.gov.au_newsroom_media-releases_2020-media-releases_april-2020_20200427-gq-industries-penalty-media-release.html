      The Fair Work Ombudsman has secured penalties of $177,174 against a Queensland construction company and its director after two young carpentry apprentices were underpaid $32,347.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court ordered Brendan Paul Angus to pay penalties of $29,529 and his company, G.Q. Industries Pty Ltd, to pay $147,645 for breaching the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The full-time apprentices, aged between 17 and 20 during the course of their employment, usually worked six days per week including overtime when working at
      <strong>
       Brisbane
      </strong>
      construction sites between September 2013 and June 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court found G.Q. Industries failed to pay a range of minimum entitlements owed under the Building and Construction General On-site Award 2010, including base rates for some ordinary hours, Saturday penalty rates, overtime rates, public holiday pay, annual and personal leave entitlements, safety net contractual entitlements and travel entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Angus and his company also took adverse action by refusing to provide one apprentice work or pay for 11 weeks after he took two days of sick leave, despite providing a doctor’s certificate. The apprentice’s training contract required him to be provided with 38 hours’ work per week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said the penalties should send a clear message that exploitation of apprentices was unacceptable.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is unlawful for employers to take adverse action against a worker for exercising their workplace rights, such as taking sick leave, and we will consider enforcement action whenever this is found,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We also treat breaches involving young workers, including apprentices, particularly seriously as they are often vulnerable as they start their careers. Any young workers with concerns should contact us.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court further found that laws relating to frequency-of-pay, record-keeping and pay slips were also breached. The company failed to provide any pay slips to one of the apprentices for 16 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Gregory Egan said the contravening conduct was “deliberate” and “could not be viewed as isolated”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The contraventions were serious. They were committed against young and vulnerable employees,” Judge Egan said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The penalties imposed reflect the need for employers, and the persons controlling the employers, to recognise that the provisions of the [Fair Work Act] relating to the payment of employees must be obeyed.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The company back-paid the two apprentices after court action was commenced.
