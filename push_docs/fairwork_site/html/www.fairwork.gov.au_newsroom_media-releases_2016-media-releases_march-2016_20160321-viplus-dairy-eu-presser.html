     <p>
      Two Taiwanese backpackers working for a dairy company were short-changed almost $7400 over three months, a Fair Work Ombudsman investigation has found.
     </p>
     <p>
      The casual workers, in Australia on 417 working holiday visas, were underpaid $3696 each while packing infant formula destined for the lucrative Chinese market.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were paid a flat rate of $15 an hour at the
      <strong>
       Toora, South Gippsland
      </strong>
      factory of Viplus Dairy Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      They should have been paid $21.09 for normal hours worked, but the company told the Fair Work Ombudsman that in addition to the $15, it provided the workers with free accommodation and utilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers, who have since returned to Taiwan, were underpaid while working at the factory for 92 days from January 12 to April 14 last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated the after the couple, who spoke limited English and communicated with Fair Work inspectors via an interpreter, contacted the Agency in July last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Viplus Dairy has now signed an Enforceable Undertaking to encourage behavioural change and ensure future compliance with its workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer co-operated with the investigation, repaid the employees and has revised its workplace practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      She said all employees working in Australia, including visa-holders, were entitled to minimum wages which were not negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      She encouraged employers with any uncertainty about their workplace obligations to visit the Fair Work Ombudsman website at www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      for advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      An interpreter service is available by calling
      <strong>
       13 14 50,
      </strong>
      and information on the website is translated into 27 languages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman currently has a national Inquiry into the wages and conditions of 417 working holiday visa-holders in Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency is now receiving more requests for assistance from visa-holders than ever before, with requests from visa-holders accounting for almost 12 per cent of all requests lodged last financial year.
