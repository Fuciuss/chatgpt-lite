      <strong>
       21 July 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Four employees laid-off by an accommodation business at
      <strong>
       Airlie Beach
      </strong>
      in Queensland have been back-paid more than $56,000 following an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employed in management, front-counter and housekeeping positions, the workers were made redundant last year – but did not get any of their entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The owners told the four female staff that the business was experiencing financial difficulties and they therefore did not have to pay them anything.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees approached the Fair Work Ombudsman seeking clarification.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated and found that the employees were indeed entitled to outstanding wages, accrued leave entitlements, redundancy pay and wages in lieu of notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      One employee had more than 10 years’ service and was owed over $25,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the employer’s claim to the contrary, Fair Work inspectors found that the business did have the funds to pay all the outstanding entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has narrowly avoided enforcement action by co-operating with the Agency and back-paying all money owed.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The business admitted it did the wrong thing and was quick to rectify the problem after we became involved,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This case is a timely reminder to employers that financial difficulties or the closure of a business do not mean workplace laws regarding redundancy and other termination entitlements can be ignored.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Redundancy entitlements play a vital supporting role for people while they attempt to pick themselves up, find a new job and get back on their feet.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website – www.fairwork.gov.au – contains a range of tools and resources to assist employers to understand their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ‘Ending Employment’ section outlines the entitlements payable in a worker's final pay and includes advice on topics such as annual leave, long service leave and redundancy pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website also includes a calculator to determine the correct notice periods for employees and information relating to employee entitlements if a business becomes bankrupt.
