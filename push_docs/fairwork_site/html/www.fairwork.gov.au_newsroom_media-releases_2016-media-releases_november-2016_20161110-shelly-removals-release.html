      <strong>
       10 November 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recovered almost $9000 for a Sri Lankan asylum seeker who was underpaid over a period of just three months at a furniture removalist business in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      .
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Shelly Removals and Storage Pty Ltd underpaid the worker for truck driving and removalist duties when it employed him between October last year and January this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was the worker’s first job in Australia since arriving as an asylum seeker a few years earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company recruited the worker, who was on a bridging visa with work rights at the time, by placing a job advertisement on a notice board at an Australian Migrant English Service centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker regularly worked 50 hours a week but was paid for only 30-to-38 of the hours – and he was paid at the unlawfully low, flat rate of $18 for those hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the practice of employers recruiting overseas workers and paying them a ‘going-rate’ below lawful Australian minimums is completely unacceptable.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Overseas workers are entitled to receive the same minimum rates and entitlements that apply to all workers in Australia – and the rates are not negotiable,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a casual under the
      <em>
       Road Transport and Distribution Award 2010
      </em>
      , the worker was entitled to receive a base rate of $23.75 per hour, up to $39.90 for overtime, up to $42.75 on weekends and up to $52.25 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shelly Removals and Storage also failed to pay his removalist and meal allowances and made an unlawful deduction from his wages for ‘insurance excess’ after he was involved in a road accident. In total, the company underpaid the worker $8711.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the worker lodged a request for assistance and the company, which did not have a history of non-compliance, and its director Sima Vaknin fully co-operated.
     </p>
     <p>
      After being educated about its obligations, the company avoided facing legal action by back-paying the worker in full and agreeing to overhaul its workplace practices by entering into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the EU, Shelly Removals and Storage will commission professional external audits of its practices this year and next year and rectify any non-compliance issues discovered.
     </p>
     <p>
      It must also report to the Fair Work Ombudsman on process improvements it has made to ensure future compliance, commission workplace relations training for its managers, display a workplace and a public notice detailing its contraventions and apologise to the worker.
