      <strong>

     </p>
     <p>
      An Indian couple promised a combined income of about $1600 a week to work in Indian restaurants in country Victoria were paid no wages for more than a year’s work, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businessman Farok Shaik allegedly provided only food and accommodation and was responsible for short-changing the husband-and-wife a total of $85,844 between August, 2012 and October, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Shaik owned and operated Indian Tandoori restaurants at several locations in regional Victoria before his company was placed into liquidation late last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Mr Shaik failed to pay the couple any wages for 14 months of full-time work they performed at restaurants in
      <strong>
       Yarrawonga
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Beechworth
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Bendigo
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The man worked as a cook and his wife performed food preparation and customer service duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      When he hired them, Mr Shaik allegedly promised wages of $800 a week each.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, it is alleged the couple were provided only with food and accommodation and were never paid any wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The couple was forced to take on extra work cleaning to earn an income.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were allegedly reluctant to complain about the lack of payment because they were reliant on Mr Shaik’s support for a Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme Visa application.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were on bridging visas while they awaited the outcome of the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      The couple eventually complained to the Fair Work Ombudsman in March, 2014 after they had ceased working at the restaurants and received advice the visa application had been declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated and allegedly established the husband-and-wife had been short-changed $42,922 each.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that in addition to the underpayment contraventions, Mr Shaik breached record-keeping and pay slip laws, including knowingly providing pay slips containing false information to a Fair Work inspector investigating the matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action was commenced because of the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the involvement of vulnerable overseas workers with only limited and basic English skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said the lack of co-operation from Mr Shaik and the failure to back-pay the employees were also concerning aspects of the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Shaik faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order for any penalties imposed against Mr Shaik to go towards back-paying the couple.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on June 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employees are entitled to be paid lawful minimum wages for work they perform and deductions from wages are lawful only when they are principally for the benefit of an employee and there is a written agreement in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman places a high priority on protecting the workplace rights of overseas workers, who can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or are reluctant to complain.
