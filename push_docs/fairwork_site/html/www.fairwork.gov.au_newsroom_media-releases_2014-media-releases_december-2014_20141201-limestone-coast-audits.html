      <strong>
       1 December 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors will doorknock more than 120 businesses on the Limestone Coast in South Australia this week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will conduct face-to-face visits in
      <strong>
       Mount Gambier, Naracoorte
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Millicent
      </strong>
      to answer employer questions about pay, conditions and other aspects of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will focus on various industry sectors, including road freight transport, retail, accommodation, cafes and restaurants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the objective is to improve awareness among local employers of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, she says it is also important to ensure that employees in the region are receiving their minimum wages and conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will focus on entitlements including minimum hourly rates, meal breaks, penalty rates for weekend, overtime and public holiday work and shift work loadings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where inspectors identify errors, their preference will be to assist employers to rectify the mistakes and put processes in place to ensure they are not repeated.
     </p>
     <p>
      They will also check compliance with record-keeping and pay slip laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2012, the Fair Work Ombudsman audited 53 tourism businesses and found 37, or 70 per cent, were compliant with their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said key stakeholders have been enlisted to assist the Agency to promote the need for compliance and a “level playing field” for all employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      These include the Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce, the Millicent Business Community Association, and the Naracoorte Lucindale Business &amp; Tourism Association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said inspectors would talk with employers about the free tools, resources and assistance the Fair Work Ombudsman has available to help them understand and comply with their workplace responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include PayCheck Plus to help employers and workers determine the correct pay rates, classifications and minimum entitlements for their industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” Ms James said.
     </p>
