      What is sexual harassment?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, workers have protections against sexual harassment. Examples of workers include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an employee
      </li>
      <li>
       a potential or future employee
      </li>
      <li>
       a contractor
      </li>
      <li>
       volunteers.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      See a full list of the types of workers with protections at

       Sexual harassment in the workplace.
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      A person's behaviour is sexual harassment if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       it’s unwelcome sexual behaviour
      </li>
      <li>
       a reasonable person might expect that the behaviour could make another person feel offended, humiliated or intimidated.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Examples of sexual harassment include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       inappropriate physical contact, such as unwelcome touching
      </li>
      <li>
       staring or leering
      </li>
      <li>
       a suggestive comment or joke
      </li>
      <li>
       a sexually explicit picture or poster
      </li>
      <li>
       an unwanted invitation to go out on dates
      </li>
      <li>
       a request for sex
      </li>
      <li>
       intrusive questioning about a person's private life or body
      </li>
      <li>
       unnecessary familiarity, such as deliberately brushing up against a person
      </li>
      <li>
       an insult or a taunt of a sexual nature
      </li>
      <li>
       a sexually explicit email or text message.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A person could also be sexually harassed by being exposed to or witnessing this kind of behaviour, such as overhearing a conversation or seeing a sexually explicit poster in the workplace.

       Ava works in an IT consultancy with Bill and Jack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ava often overhears Bill and Jack making sexually inappropriate jokes to each other at work. Bill also has a sexually explicit screensaver on his work computer, which Ava often sees when she walks past his desk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ava feels uncomfortable and talks to her manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill and Jack say Ava is being too sensitive. They also say that what they talk about at work or have on their computers has nothing to do with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill and Jack’s behaviour could still be considered sexual harassment even if it doesn’t involve Ava directly.

      Sexual harassment may be repeated actions or it can be a one-off incident. It can happen in person, online or over the phone.

      Bullying

     <h3>
      What is bullying?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, bullying happens at work when:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a person or group of people repeatedly behave unreasonably towards another worker or group of workers
      </li>
      <li>
       the behaviour creates a risk to health and safety.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Examples of bullying include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       behaving aggressively towards others
      </li>
      <li>
       teasing or playing practical jokes
      </li>
      <li>
       pressuring someone to behave inappropriately
      </li>
      <li>
       excluding someone from work-related events
      </li>
      <li>
       unreasonable work demands.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      What isn’t bullying?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Reasonable management action that's carried out in a reasonable way is not bullying.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer or manager can:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       make decisions about poor performance
      </li>
      <li>
       take disciplinary action
      </li>
      <li>
       direct and control the way work is carried out.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Management action that isn't carried out in a reasonable way may be considered bullying.

       Caleb has started work for a coffee distributor. It is his first full-time job and he is a little nervous. Although he tries his best, he has made a few mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Caleb’s manager, John, has yelled at Caleb in front of other staff and told Caleb that he will not be allowed to attend the staff Christmas party if he doesn’t improve. John now insists that another employee has to check all of Caleb’s paperwork, and he makes jokes to staff about how he can’t let Caleb speak to clients unsupervised.
      </p>
      <p>
       John hasn’t met with Caleb to discuss Caleb’s work and how it could improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       John’s behaviour could be considered bullying because it goes beyond reasonable management action.
