      <strong>
       5 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A Court has penalised a western
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      hair and beauty salon $21,000 for ignoring a Fair Work Ombudsman request to back-pay an underpaid hairdresser $4,668.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has imposed the penalty against Hair Industrie Mt Druitt Pty Ltd, which operates at the Westfield
      <strong>
       Mt Druitt
      </strong>
      complex.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the Court has ordered the company to back-pay the hairdresser in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty and back-payment order are the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman, which investigated after the hairdresser lodged a request for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the hairdresser, aged in her 50s, was underpaid $4668 in wages, penalty rates and leave entitlements between July, 2012 and February, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      In April, 2014, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued Hair Industrie Mt Druitt a Compliance Notice that required the underpayment to be rectified within 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company did not respond to the Notice or a follow-up letter from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, companies must comply with Compliance Notices issued by the Fair Work Ombudsman or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      In his judgment, Judge Nicholas Manousaridis said the Fair Work Ombudsman attempted to contact Hair Industrie Mt Druitt a number of times, but the company made no attempt to respond - which showed a disregard for its lawful obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Manousaridis said the underpayment was significant, having occurred over only seven months, and the failure to adhere to the Compliance Notice was deliberate.
     </p>
     <p>
      “There is no evidence Hair Industrie has expressed contrition; nor is there any evidence it has taken any corrective action or has attempted to cooperate with the Fair Work Ombudsman,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is not acceptable to underpay employees’ basic entitlements and then refuse to rectify the matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We often attempt to resolve matters such as this one outside of the Courts through issuing Compliance Notices – but we are prepared to initiate legal action where Notices are ignored and we believe it is in the public interest to do so,” Ms James said.
