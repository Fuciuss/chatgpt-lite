      <strong>
       21 November 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      More than three-quarters of businesses in
      <strong>
       Tamworth
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Armidale
      </strong>
      in regional NSW are complying with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations under federal workplace laws, random checks by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors made face-to-face visits to 177 employers as part of an ongoing effort to raise awareness among employers of the importance of keeping proper records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman continues to see employers failing to keep adequate records and issuing pay slips that do not contain the required information.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inadequate records hamper the ability of Fair Work inspectors to determine if employees are being paid correctly if a dispute arises over wages. In the past, the Agency has taken legal action against some employers who did not keep adequate records and who were suspected of underpaying their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman liaised with the Armidale and Tamworth Business Chambers before commencing site visits in November last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auditing has now concluded and the results are revealed in a report released today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninety-seven per cent of employers (171) were found to be meeting their record-keeping responsibilities and 89 per cent (157) were complying with pay slip laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the issues identified related to employers failing to keep records of hours worked by employees and failing to issue employees with sufficiently-detailed pay slips within one working day of pay day.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleven per cent of employers (20) had not been providing a copy of the Fair Work Information Statement to new employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James today welcomed the high compliance rates but stressed the importance of businesses being diligent about meeting their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      â€œBusinesses who fail to keep proper employment records and issue sufficiently detailed pay slips are at much higher risk of underpaying their employees," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it was particularly pleasing to see the employers who made mistakes promptly rectify their errors and put processes in place to ensure future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      During their visits, Fair Work inspectors informed employers of the free resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au to assist them to comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online resources include templates for time-and-wages records and pay slips, fact sheets and tools for determining correct rates of pay for employees, such as PayCheck Plus.
     </p>
