      <strong>
       18 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A
      <strong>
       South Australian
      </strong>
      worker who was paid just $15-an-hour for almost seven years is now being back-paid $22,000 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The female employee worked as a receptionist and shop assistant at a retail business on the
      <strong>
       Fleurieu Peninsula.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      She was paid $15 an hour when she started as an 18-year-old in 2008 and was still on the same rate when she resigned in January, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee lodged a request for assistance with the Fair Work Ombudsman after being asked to train a new employee, who told her she was being paid $23.50 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated and determined that as a casual employee under the
      <em>
       General Retail Award
      </em>
      , by 2015 she should have been paid $23.15 an hour on weekdays and $25.01 on Saturdays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business has co-operated with the Fair Work Ombudsman and agreed to a plan to back-pay the former employee in instalments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the case highlights the importance of regional South Australian employers reviewing staff pay rates periodically to ensure they are meeting their lawful obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Underpayment of hourly rates can result in employees being significantly underpaid if left unchecked for an extended period, which can leave businesses facing big back-payments they weren't budgeting for," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says minimum pay rates generally increase on July 1 each year following the Fair Work Commission’s Annual Wage Review decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Employers sometimes overlook the need to adjust pay rates," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      'Employers need to be aware that the Annual Wage Review decision increases not only the National Minimum Wage, but also base rates of pay in modern awards and enterprise agreements."
