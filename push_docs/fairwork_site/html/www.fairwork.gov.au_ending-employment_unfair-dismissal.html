      Applying for unfair dismissal
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Commission (the Commission) decides on cases of unfair dismissal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees need to apply to the Commission within 21 days of the dismissal taking effect. The 21 day period starts the day after the dismissal.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you think you have been unfairly dismissed, you should contact the Commission as soon as possible.

      Minimum employment period
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees need to be employed for at least 6 months before they can apply for unfair dismissal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees working for a small business need to be employed for at least 12 months before they can apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there was a change of business ownership, service with the first employer may count as service with the second employer when calculating the minimum employment period.

      Small businesses have different rules for dismissal.

       Small Business Fair Dismissal Code
      </a>
      provides protection against unfair dismissal claims, where an employer follows the Code. The Commission will deem a dismissal to be fair if the employer follows the Code and can provide evidence of this.
     </p>
     <p>
      A small business is defined as any business with less than 15 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      To figure out whether a business is a small business, count all employees employed at the time of the dismissal including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee and any other employees being dismissed at that time
      </li>
      <li>
       regular and systematic casual employees employed by the business at the time of the dismissal (not all casual employees)
      </li>
      <li>
       employees of
       <a data-href="/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2116" href="/taxonomy/term/487">
        associated entities
       </a>
       , including those based overseas.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The size of the business is counted the earliest of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       when the employee is told their employment has been terminated, or
      </li>
      <li>
       when the employee is given their

      Employees can also apply to the Commission if they’ve been dismissed on the basis of:

       a breach of general protections, or
