      <strong>
       22 August 2014

     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is conducting further checks of 200
      <strong>
       Victorian
      </strong>
      employers previously found to be in breach of federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second round of auditing of employment records is to ensure that businesses are now meeting their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors have selected employers from
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      and regional locations including
      <strong>
       Ballarat
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Bendigo
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Cobram
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Echuca
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Geelong, Mildura
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Rutherglen
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Seymour
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Wangaratta
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Warrnambool
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Yarrawonga
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      All of those included in the latest campaign have previously underpaid their employees or made record-keeping and pay-slip mistakes over the past 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each business operator subsequently received assistance from Fair Work inspectors to understand their obligations and put processes in place to ensure future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the follow-up checks aim to ensure the businesses are achieving ongoing compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important for us to check that employers now understand their responsibilities and are providing employees with their full lawful entitlements,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We also want to understand if any non-compliance issues might be continuing, because that will help us better direct our education and campaign activities in future.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Where inspectors find businesses which are still non-compliant, they will require employers to correct the issues and back-pay any underpaid wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will consider enforcement measures in cases of continued non-compliance, such as issuing Infringement Notices (on-the-spot fines) of up to $2550. In the event of a matter being so serious it warrants legal action, penalties of up to $51,000 per breach are applicable to companies and $10,200 to individuals.
