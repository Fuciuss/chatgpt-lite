      <strong>
       24 February 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operator of a Nando's restaurant in
      <strong>
       Canberra
      </strong>
      has been found short-changing its young workers thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thirteen casual employees aged between 16 and 25 were underpaid almost $27,500.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most were paid a flat rate of $18 an hour for all hours worked, including weekends and public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      , they should have been paid at least $17.35 for a Level 1 adult for ordinary hours worked, up to $26.03 on weekends and $43.38 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were underpaid for work performed between July 1, 2014 and June 30 last year at Nando's Canberra City, run by C &amp; JT Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments, which ranged from $36 to $4791, were identified when Fair Work inspectors audited the business as part of a pro-active education and compliance campaign in the ACT.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has demonstrated a willingness to make changes to its workplace practices to ensure future compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business has signed an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman aimed at encouraging behavioural change.
     </p>
     <p>
      The EU requires:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Back-payment of all outstanding wages and entitlements,
      </li>
      <li>
       An apology for the conduct to the affected employees,
      </li>
      <li>
       Registration with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Online tool My Account,
      </li>
      <li>
       A commitment to future compliance with federal workplace laws, and
      </li>
      <li>
       The appointment of an external professional to audit the business’s compliance with workplace laws for the next three years.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is important for anyone running a business to ensure they understand the workplace laws applicable to their business, and the Fair Work Ombudsman has a range of free tools and resources to assist.
     </p>
     <p>
      She encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Small Business Helpline for advice on
