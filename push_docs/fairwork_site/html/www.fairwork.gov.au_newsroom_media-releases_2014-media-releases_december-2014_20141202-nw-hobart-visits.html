      <strong>
       2 December 2014
      </strong>

       Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors will visit more than 50 businesses in Hobart this week to assist employers to meet their obligations under workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will conduct face-to-face visits in the north-western suburbs to answer employer questions about pay and conditions and monitor compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will focus on a range of industries, including retail, hospitality and social services.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the objective is to improve awareness of workplace laws among Tasmanian employers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, Ms James says it is also important that the Fair Work Ombudsman ensures employees are receiving their minimum entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will focus on minimum hourly rates, meal breaks, penalty rates for weekend, overtime and public holiday work and shift work loadings.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Where inspectors identify errors, their preference will be to assist employers to rectify the mistakes and put processes in place to ensure they are not repeated.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In instances where serious non-compliance is detected, inspectors will consider appropriate enforcement actions.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James said key stakeholders had been enlisted to assist the Agency to promote the need for compliance and a “level playing field” for all employers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       These include the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Tasmanian Small Business Council, the Australian Hotels Association and United Voice.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James said inspectors will talk to employers about the free tools, resources and assistance the Fair Work Ombudsman has available to help them understand and comply with their workplace responsibilities.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Online tools include PayCheck Plus to help employers and workers determine the correct pay rates, classifications and minimum entitlements for their industry.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” Ms James said.
      </span>
