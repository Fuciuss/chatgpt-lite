     <p>
      A small business is one that employs less than 15 employees. Some small businesses don’t have to pay redundancy pay when making an employee redundant.
     </p>
     <p>
      To check if small businesses need to pay redundancy pay, select your industry in
      <a href="/ending-employment/redundancy/redundancy-pay-and-entitlements/default">
       Redundancy pay and entitlements
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      To figure out whether the business is a small business, count all employees employed at the time of the dismissal including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee and any other employees being terminated at that time
      </li>
      <li>
       regular and systematic casual employees employed by the business at the time of the redundancy (not all casual employees)
      </li>
      <li>
       employees of
       <a data-href="/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2116" href="/taxonomy/term/487">
        associated entities
       </a>
       , including those based overseas.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The time of dismissal is when an employer provides an employee with their notice of termination. It doesn't matter if an employee works out their notice period or not.
