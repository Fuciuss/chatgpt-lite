       The Fair Work Ombudsman is auditing 75 businesses in South Australia’s Barossa and Adelaide Plains regions as part of a new campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The three-month campaign will focus on businesses located in the
       <strong>
        Barossa Valley
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Gawler
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Two Wells
       </strong>
       until the end of June.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors are checking employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations is also being monitored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The campaign is focusing on employers across various sectors, including retail, health care, road transport, electrical services, food and drink factory workers and crop.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       All businesses will be randomly selected.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Key local employer groups and unions have been enlisted to help the Agency promote the campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Barossa and Adelaide Plains regions are home to thousands of businesses and have had population growth higher than the State average and experienced significant employment shifts between industry sectors in recent years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Inspectors will offer tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure employers get things right in the future.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, an Online learning centre and My Account, which enables employers and employees to save information on pay and conditions for their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit the website or call the Fair Work Infoline on
       <strong>
        13 13 94
       </strong>
       . An interpreter service is also available by calling
       <strong>
        13 14 50
       </strong>
       . Small businesses calling the Infoline can opt to receive priority service to assist with their inquiries.
