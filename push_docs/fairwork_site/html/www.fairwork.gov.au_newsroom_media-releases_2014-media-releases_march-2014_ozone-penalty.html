       12 March 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former director of an environmental control products company who was involved in underpaying eight employees in
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      has been fined $28,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court in Adelaide has imposed the penalty against Sydney man Simon Forbes Oke following legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oke was the majority owner and sole director of Ozone Manufacturing Pty Ltd before the company was placed into liquidation last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court ordered the penalty be paid to the eight underpaid employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      They are still owed a total of more than $73,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ozone Manufacturing was involved in designing, manufacturing and distributing products for dust and fume control and air and water purification.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company had a manufacturing site at
      <strong>
       Woodville North
      </strong>
      in Adelaide and a sales operation at
      <strong>
       Balmain
      </strong>
      in Sydney.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five manufacturing employees in South Australia were underpaid a total of $17,018 and three sales employees in NSW were underpaid a total of $56,036 in wages, annual leave and personal leave entitlements between January and October, 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oke, of
      <strong>
       Rozelle
      </strong>
      , was also involved in a failure to comply with a Notice to Produce employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must comply with requests from Fair Work inspectors to provide records relating to employees and former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace laws relating to superannuation and frequency-of-pay were also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We do not apologise for taking legal action when employers dismiss the efforts of Fair Work inspectors to resolve these issues voluntarily," Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      She said the penalty should serve as a reminder to other company directors that they can face personal liability for their actions.
