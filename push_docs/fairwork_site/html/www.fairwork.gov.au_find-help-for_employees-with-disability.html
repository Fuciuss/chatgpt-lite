      Minimum pay rate and Supported Wage System
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every employee is entitled to a minimum rate of pay. For most employees, this minimum rate is set by the award that covers their industry or occupation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Supported Wage System is for employees with disability who are not able to perform jobs at the same capacity as any other employee.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Under the Supported Wage System an employee's work capacity is assessed to find out their rate of pay. This assessment can only be carried out by a qualified independent assessor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Use our
      <a href="https://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay-and-wages/pay-calculator">
       Pay and Conditions Tool
      </a>
      to calculate pay rates for employees who are eligible for a supported wage.
