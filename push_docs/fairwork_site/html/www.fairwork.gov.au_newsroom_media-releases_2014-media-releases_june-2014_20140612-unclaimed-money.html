      <strong>

     </p>
     <p>
      Workers who believe they may have been underpaid in a previous job are being encouraged to check whether they are entitled to a share of unclaimed wages totalling $2.7 million.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recovered the money for 9500 people who cannot be located.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many may not even know they were underpaid and left the job before the shortfall in their wages was identified.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest amount being held on behalf of an individual is $21,000 for the estate of deceased employee who worked at an
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      retirement village.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other significant amounts being held in trust include $14,100 for a former employee of a
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      fishing company, $11,500 for a former employee of labour-hire company in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      and $10,300 for a former employee of a restaurant in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Money has been held for some employees for more than 10 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has set up a facility on its website which allows people to check whether or not they may be owed outstanding entitlements.
     </p>

      , click on the ‘Resources’ tab and select the ‘search for unpaid wages’ option. Users need to enter their family name, as well as the business/entity name or Australian Business Number (ABN) of a former employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency and its predecessors have recovered more than $200 million for over 100,000 people since March, 2006.
     </p>
     <p>
      “When we audit a business with non-compliance issues, we often identify underpayments of current as well as former employees,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We make extensive efforts to locate the underpaid former employees to facilitate back-payment but when they can’t be located, the business pays the outstanding wages to the Commonwealth to be held in trust.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman staff use phone directories, the internet, social media and other measures to try to locate those who are owed money.
     </p>
     <p>
      An
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      man in his 60s was recently located and received a cheque for $32,000. He was underpaid at work more than six years ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      And in a separate case, $4000 was returned to each of two former
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      service technicians who were also underpaid in 2008.
     </p>
