      There are simple and practical steps small business operators can take to find the right staff for their workplace, according to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses that invest time in planning their recruitment are more likely to find someone who is the right fit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Good recruitment practices and a proper induction process will help employers get their new employee started on the right foot and contributing to productivity sooner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before advertising a role, employers should think about what they need from the person they are hiring and develop a job description to match, taking into consideration the tasks that need to be done and skills and qualifications required.
     </p>
     <p>
      The next step is to ensure the right applicants hear about the opportunity and find the job appealing, says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      She suggests job advertisements should be specific about what skills and experience are required to ensure suitable candidates apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The interview process can be as formal or informal as employers like - the focus should be on asking the right questions so the candidate's skills and experience can be matched with the job that needs to be done," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Avoid asking questions that are personal, intrusive or irrelevant to the role as they may be seen as discriminatory."
     </p>
     <p>
      After the best candidate has been chosen and has accepted the position, it is important that time is invested in a thorough induction to get the most from a new employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      "A thorough induction does take a bit more time, but it has long-term benefits, "Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "New employees who are well-informed and have a clear direction of what's expected of them will feel confident to go ahead and do the job they were hired to do."
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has launched a guide to hiring new employees for small business that outlines these steps and provides straight-forward advice about hiring new staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The guide was created to give small business operators advice in plain-English about the best way to employ new workers and to outline their workplace obligations in simple terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We want to help small business recruit the right people and grow their business by understanding the process of hiring staff," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The guide will be complemented by an interactive online learning course that employers can access for free to improve their skills in hiring and inducting new staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The course includes an interactive tool to help employers build a profile of the employee they want to hire and a video activity to help them practice their interview skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      The course will be available at the Online Learning Centre on the Fair Work Ombudsman's website at
      <a href="/how-we-will-help/online-training/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/learning
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Another course titled 'Difficult conversations in the workplace' has practical tips to help employers develop the skills and confidence to have a difficult conversation in the workplace and minimise disputes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Encouraging communication in the workplace and equipping people with the information they need to resolve workplace issues is important for us," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "By providing employers with reliable and credible tools and resources, we are able to help them better understand their options for resolution and how to work at best practice."
     </p>
     <p>
      Feedback was sought from a number of representative bodies when creating the guide to hiring new employees and online learning course.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We're serious about getting input from those who are part of the small business community, and tailoring our services to suit their needs, so consultation is a really important part of our work," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier this month, the Fair Work Ombudsman met with members of the small business community at a Roundtable in Melbourne to discuss how the Fair Work agencies can best assist small business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The discussion was co-hosted by the Fair Work Ombudsman, Fair Work Commission General Manager Bernadette O'Neill and Director of Fair Work Building and Construction, Nigel Hadgkiss.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commonwealth Small Business Minister, the Hon. Bruce Billson, also attended the forum, spoke to participants and fielded questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recently established a dedicated Small Business Strategy Team that has been tasked with responding to the needs of small businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      A dedicated webpage for small business, including free tools and resources, is available at
      <a href="/find-help-for/small-business/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/smallbusiness
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
