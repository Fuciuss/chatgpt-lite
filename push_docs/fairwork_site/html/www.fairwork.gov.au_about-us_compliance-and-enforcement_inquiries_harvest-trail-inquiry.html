      About the Harvest Trail
     </h2>
     <p>
      Every year, seasonal harvest workers follow the ‘Harvest Trail’ of ripening fruit, vegetables and other crops around Australia. From January grape picking in the Hunter Valley to autumn apples in Tasmania, October mangoes in the Northern Territory and cherries at Christmas time, the horticulture and viticulture industries employ many travellers and seasoned harvesters.
     </p>
     <p>
      The horticulture sector is key area of focus for FWO. Our experience of working with employers and employees in the horticulture industry has shown there is often:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       confusion about employer obligations, including how to use piece rate agreements
      </li>
      <li>
       a lack of understanding about grower’s obligations when using a labour hire service.
      </li>
     </ul>

      Harvest Trail Inquiry Report
     </h2>
     <p>
      Our Harvest Trail Inquiry started in August 2013. We focused on visiting and revisiting Harvest Trail regions to help employers and employees understand their workplace rights and obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      We looked at issues such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       minimum wages and conditions, including piece rates
      </li>
      <li>
       record keeping and pay slips
      </li>
      <li>
       labour hire and supply chain issues.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Some of the discoveries we made during our Harvest Trail Inquiry include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       misuse of piece rates
      </li>
      <li>
       a negative impact where labour hire arrangements were used illegally
      </li>
      <li>
       low consumer awareness and unwillingness to pay more for ‘domestic fair trade’ produce contributes to exploitation.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
