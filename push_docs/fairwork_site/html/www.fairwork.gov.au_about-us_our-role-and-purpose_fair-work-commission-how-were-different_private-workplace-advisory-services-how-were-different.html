      Members of the public have expressed concern about the conduct of private businesses that offer workplace relations advisory services.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have received complaints from the public that they have been misled into believing that businesses are, or were, connected or affiliated with the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) or other government agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO has received complaints relating to a website at the address www.fairworkhelp.com.au and telephone advisory service operated by Employsure Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any business engages in conduct that misleads consumers about a connection or affiliation with the FWO, the FWO considers it a serious issue. When we become aware of complaints of conduct of this nature, we consider the full range of options available and are willing to take appropriate steps to prevent further misrepresentations likely to mislead consumers.
