     <p>
      Starting a new job can be daunting, especially when you’re a first-time worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      To help make it easier, the Fair Work Ombudsman has created
      <em>
       A guide to starting a new job
      </em>
      , which aims to prepare young people for the first day at work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says starting a new job can be an exciting time, but with it comes a range of new responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We also know that it can be nerve-wracking for first-time workers and they can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their workplace rights,” she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our new guide provides information and advice that should give first-time employees confidence for the best possible start.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Available on our
      <a href="/find-help-for/young-workers-and-students/default">
       Young workers and students page
      </a>
      at www.fairwork.gov.au/newjob, the guide is one of many resources available on the Fair Work Ombudsman website to assist young workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      It covers issues such as:
     </p>
     <h2>
      Your first day
     </h2>
     <p>
      You’ll need to remember a lot of new things on your first day. If you’re not sure, ask questions.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Confirm the address of your workplace, who you need to report to, what time you’re expected to start and what hours you’ll work.
      </li>
      <li>
       Be aware of what your main duties are and if a dress code applies.
      </li>
      <li>
       Figure out how you’ll get to work and how long it will take.
      </li>
      <li>
       Ask if there is a kitchen or meals area to prepare or buy food.
      </li>
      <li>
       Complete any required paperwork, including forms about taxation and superannuation.
      </li>
      <li>
       Provide your employer with your bank account details.
      </li>
      <li>
       Find out what policies apply in your new workplace, for example what procedures apply when taking sick leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      How to get the most out of your job
     </h2>
     <p>
      There are a number of skills that can help you succeed in a new job:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Be flexible, positive, trustworthy and a team player.
      </li>
      <li>
       Communicate clearly with your colleagues.
      </li>
      <li>
       Work on your problem solving, planning and organisational skills.
      </li>
      <li>
       Work collaboratively with your team and independently when required.
      </li>
      <li>
       Show initiative and a commitment to learning and developing new skills.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      Resolving workplace issues
     </h2>
     <p>
      Issues can arise even in the best workplaces, and you’ll need to figure out how to resolve them when they arise:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Don’t put off having a difficult conversation, it’s important to deal with issues before they get worse.
      </li>
      <li>
       Speak with your employer about the issue.
      </li>
      <li>
       Be prepared to take a flexible and practical approach to resolving the issue.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman supports compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
