       Dozens of workers in Melbourne’s East have been reimbursed more than $105,000 after inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman revealed they had been underpaid at work.
      </span>
      <span>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The largest recovery was $24,300 for 18 workers at a
       <strong>
        Camberwell
       </strong>
       café underpaid their penalty rates for shift work, weekends and public holidays and annual leave loading entitlements. Some employees were also underpaid their minimum hourly rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The underpayments occurred because the business was not fully aware of its workplace obligations. Inspectors determined that the underpayments were not deliberate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the case highlights the importance of employers being diligent when it comes to understanding the wages and entitlements applicable to their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It is important employers are fully aware of their responsibilities, otherwise they can end up facing back-payment bills they weren’t budgeting for,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Other recent recoveries include:
      </span>

      <li>
       <span>

       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $6200 for 17 shop assistants at a
        <strong>
         Croydon
        </strong>
        bakery underpaid the minimum hourly rate and weekend penalty rates in 2013 and earlier this year, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $5900 for 10 workers at a
        <strong>
         Camberwell
        </strong>
        café underpaid weekend penalty rates from July last year until May.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James said the employees were reimbursed without the need for further action after Fair Work inspectors contacted the employers and explained their obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We’re confident the underpayments were inadvertent and it’s pleasing that employers accepted our assistance to put processes in place to ensure future compliance,” she said.
