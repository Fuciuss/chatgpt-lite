      Good communication practices can help prevent workplace problems from occurring, and resolve issues quickly. Employers and employees are both responsible for communicating with each other at and about work.

      In our experience, if issues arise in the workplace, having an open and respectful conversation can help to resolve the problem. It is best to raise any issues or concerns as early as possible. This can help prevent small issues from becoming big problems later on.
     </p>
     <p>
      We understand that this may not always be possible and you may need to seek our help to resolve the problem.

      Employees have a responsibility just like employers to make sure they communicate effectively in the workplace. If you have a question about your work or a workplace issue, we encourage you to speak to your employer about it first.

     <p>
      Good communication starts from the day you hire a new employee. You should make sure that your employees are comfortable asking you questions and raising issues or concerns with you or a manager. This way any issues can be identified and resolved as quickly as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most awards and agreements require making a copy of the award or enterprise agreement available and easily accessible to staff. Making sure staff are aware of their classifications within their award or agreement can also help staff understand your expectations.

      You can use our

     <p>
      There are many ways you can continue to communicate in the workplace, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       regular staff meetings
      </li>
      <li>
       performance reviews

       Setting clear expectations from the start of employment and making important workplace information readily available can help prevent workplace problems. This could include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        providing information about leave balances
       </li>
       <li>
        communicating the process, expectations and any restrictions about requesting leave
       </li>
       <li>
        outlining where staff can access dispute resolution processes.

      Consultation

     <p>
      Consultation with employees about changes to their role, employment conditions, or the work environment is critical for a productive and engaging workplace. Consultation is also required in some situations. Check your award or agreement for consultation provisions. Consultation also helps staff feel engaged and supported.
