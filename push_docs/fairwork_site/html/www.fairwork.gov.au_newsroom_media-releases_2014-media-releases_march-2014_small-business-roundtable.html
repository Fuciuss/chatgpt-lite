      The Fair Work Ombudsman will meet with key members of the small business community at a roundtable in Melbourne today.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aim of the three-hour forum is to "start a conversation" about how the Fair Work agencies can work together to support small business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The discussion is being co-hosted by Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James, Fair Work Commission General Manager Bernadette O'Neill and the Director of Fair Work Building and Construction, Nigel Hadgkiss.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commonwealth Small Business Minister, the Hon. Bruce Billson, will attend for part of the proceedings.

      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that as a regulator, it is important for her agency to strike the right balance between education and compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We need to understand the impact of what we propose on the people affected by it, particularly small business people," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Understanding the perspectives of small business will help us, either as regulators or adjudicators, to assess whether we are adequately supporting the needs of those who require our help.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Ultimately, we want to ensure that small business people have every opportunity to meet their workplace obligations and have access to reliable, credible resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We recognise that more often than not, employers want to do the right thing, and today's roundtable is about ensuring that we are well positioned to help our small business clients."
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recently established a dedicated Small Business Strategy Team that has been tasked with responding to the needs of small businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We're serious about getting input from those who are part of the small business community, and tailoring our services and resources to suit their needs, so consultation is a really important part of our work," Ms James said.
     </p>
