      Workers at two regional Victorian accommodation businesses have been back-paid more than $15,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      A business at
      <strong>
       Mansfield
      </strong>
      short-changed 21 of its casual employees a total of $9000 as a result of underpaying their minimum hourly rates and penalty rates for night and weekend work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were paid flat hourly rates that were not sufficient to cover the minimum rates they were entitled to under the Hospitality Industry Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest single underpayment was $1340.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments occurred during last year’s snow season and were discovered by Fair Work inspectors during proactive audit activity focusing on snowfields employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, a business at
      <strong>
       Rutherglen
      </strong>
      reimbursed 16 cleaners, waiters and kitchen staff a total of $6800 after underpaying their minimum hourly rates and penalty rates for weekend and shift work between July and October last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest single underpayment was $3672.
     </p>
     <p>
      The inadvertent underpayments were the result of the employer’s lack of awareness of the lawful minimum pay rates that applied under the Hospitality Industry Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the underpayments when they proactively audited the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both businesses promptly back-paid employees all money owed after Fair Work inspectors explained their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says her Agency is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important that there be a fair, competitive environment for employers who are doing the right thing by creating a level playing field in relation to business costs,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Anyone operating a business needs to ensure they take the time to understand the workplace laws applicable to their business.”
