      Paid leave also doesn't accumulate when an employee is getting the Australian Government Paid Parental Leave Scheme payments, if the person is taking unpaid leave from their employer at this time.

      Paid leave may accumulate when an employee is on employer-funded paid parental leave.

      Paid Parental Leave scheme
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Paid Parental Leave scheme is a Services Australia scheme that provides financial support for eligible parents usually through their employer. This scheme is separate to unpaid parental leave and employer-funded paid parental leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees can use parental leave pay (PLP) before, after or at the same time as their paid and unpaid leave entitlements. This includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       annual leave
      </li>
      <li>
       long service leave
      </li>
      <li>
       unpaid parental leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>

       Example: Taking annual leave during unpaid parental leave
      </h3>
      <p>
       Maggie is about to take 12 months unpaid parental leave. She wants to take some annual leave during her leave so she has income in the later months of her unpaid leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maggie agrees with her employer to take 4 weeks annual leave in her ninth month of unpaid parental leave. These 4 weeks don't extend Maggie's unpaid parental leave period. Instead, they will run at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maggie will accrue annual leave and sick or carer’s leave during the 4 week period. This is because paid leave accrues during an annual leave period.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a public holiday during Maggie's annual leave. She won't be on annual leave for the public holiday and won't get paid for it. She agrees with her employer to extend her period of annual leave by 1 day, so she still gets paid for 4 weeks of leave.
