     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is urging workers who believe they may have been underpaid by labour hire contractors for work at Baiada poultry processing plants this year to lodge their claims before a December 31 deadline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under a compliance partnership with the Fair Work Ombudsman signed in October, Baiada agreed to rectify any underpayment of wages by its labour hire contractors from January 1 this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the agreement only applies to workers who lodge claims before the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Baiada has set aside $500,000 to reimburse the workers, with any funds remaining to be distributed to various nominated charities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Baiada agreed to make the back-payments and to continue to implement a range of changes as part of its commitment to work with the Fair Work Ombudsman to stamp out unlawful practices by its contractors at its NSW worksites.
