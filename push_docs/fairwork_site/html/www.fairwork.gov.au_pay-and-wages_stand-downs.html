     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       under an award, enterprise agreement or employment contract, or

      Stand downs under an award, enterprise agreement or employment contract

      Employers should check any applicable award, enterprise agreement or employment contract to see if any stand down provisions apply. An award or agreement might also include consultation obligations or industry-specific rules for a stand down.

      Stand downs under the Fair Work Act
     </h3>
     <p>
      If there are no relevant rules in an award, agreement or employment contract on stand downs, then the Fair Work Act provisions usually apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      A stand down under the Fair Work Act is when an employee can't do useful work because:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       equipment breaks down, if the employer isn't responsible for it
      </li>
      <li>
       <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f811d5c-5e5c-48d2-8192-bc6900db6691" href="/employment-conditions/industrial-action-and-protests" title="Industrial action and protests">
        industrial action
       </a>
       , when it's not organised by the employer
      </li>
      <li>
       work stops for a reason that the employer can't be held responsible for, such as:
       <ul>
        <li>
         due to lack of supply
        </li>
        <li>
         a natural disaster, or
        </li>
        <li>
         the business has closed because of an enforceable government direction.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers can't stand an employee down just because the business is quiet or there isn't enough work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Act stand down provisions only apply when an employee’s enterprise agreement or employment contract doesn’t have stand down provisions. Employers should check the relevant enterprise agreement or employment contract to see if it has any stand down provisions that apply.

      <h3>
       Best practice tip
      </h3>
      <p>
       If an employer does stand down employees under the Fair Work Act, it’s best practice to tell those employees in writing (where possible), including:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the start date of the stand down
       </li>
       <li>
        whether the employees will or will not be paid
       </li>
       <li>
        the effect on other employment entitlements.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Employers should also try to update employees about when they think the stand down will end.

      Working from home arrangements

      Alternative working arrangements such as working from home might be suitable depending on the business and the employee's work.

      Changes to duties, hours of work or rosters
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employers can talk to their employees about temporarily agreeing to change their duties, rosters or hours if this means an employee can keep working. There are different ways that employers and employees may be able to make these kinds of changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers need to check the rules under the applicable award or agreement, as well as the employee's employment contract and any workplace policies. Employers will usually need to consult with their employees about these types of changes.

     <h3>
      Accessing paid or unpaid leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employers and employees can also arrange for the employee to take leave. Options include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       taking accrued annual leave
      </li>
      <li>
       taking other paid leave (such as long service leave or paid leave available under an award, enterprise agreement or employment contract)
      </li>
      <li>
       taking other paid leave by agreement between the employee and the employer.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employee accessing paid annual leave or long service leave during a stand down won't be considered stood down while on leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some circumstances, employees won't have access to paid leave. For example, if they’ve used all their accrued leave entitlements. In these situations, employers and employees can agree for an employee to take unpaid leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees may also be able to direct an employee to take accrued annual leave in certain circumstances. Learn more at

      Pay

     <p>
      During a stand down, an employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       doesn't need to be paid
      </li>
      <li>
       accrues leave based on their normal hours had they been working (such as annual leave and sick and carer’s leave)
      </li>

       will be paid for any public holidays that fall during the period.

      Leave

     <p>
      Employees can agree with their employer to use certain types of paid leave during a stand down. Examples include:

     </ul>
     <p>
      Employees who are stood down without pay under the Fair Work Act can't use paid sick and carer's leave or compassionate leave during the stand down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees who are stood down without pay under the Fair Work Act are entitled to be paid for public holidays that fall during the stand down period. This applies if the employee would normally have ordinary hours of work falling on the day of the public holiday.

      Time away from work due to a stand down counts towards an employee’s service. This means that time stood down is included when calculating an employee’s entitlements under the National Employment Standards including:

      Disputes about stand down

     <p>
      If there is a dispute about a stand down, an application to deal with a dispute can be made to the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an employee
      </li>
      <li>
       a union
      </li>
      <li>
       a Fair Work inspector.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the Commission makes an order about the dispute, you need to follow it or you risk being penalised.
