      Understanding outworkers entitlements
     </h2>
     <p>
      In the textile, clothing and footwear industry, businesses can engage outworkers directly or enter an arrangement with outworkers to perform work outside of their business. Businesses have specific responsibilities and have to ensure their outworkers receive certain conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outworkers are people who work at home or at a place that isn’t a typical business premises, for example, a garage attached to a person’s house. Their work typically involves:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       making clothing, bags or footwear
      </li>
      <li>
       cutting, sewing, or finishing work such as embroidery or sewing tags onto apparel
      </li>
      <li>
       manufacturing buttons and textiles.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Textile, clothing and footwear outworkers engaged as contractors are considered to be employees for the purpose of most protections under the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most outworkers working in the textile, clothing and footwear industry are covered by the
      <a href="https://library.fairwork.gov.au/award/?krn=MA000017">
       Textile and Clothing Award
      </a>
      , whether they are employees or contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Textile and Clothing Award is a legal document that provides for wages and other conditions for outworkers, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       information outworkers must be given
      </li>
      <li>
       minimum pay and conditions
      </li>
      <li>
       work records
      </li>
      <li>
       written agreements.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A full list of what outworkers are entitled to can be found on our
      <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5def41dd-8ad3-4cd5-aa12-8a5da0181526" href="/find-help-for/outworkers" title="Outworkers">

      </a>
      page.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Textile and Clothing Award still applies when there’s a registered agreement in place that covers the outworker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outworker rules and obligations under the Fair Work Act and the Textile and Clothing Award needs to be considered together with any state or territory laws that apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a business engages outworkers in a different industry, they’re entitled to the same pay and conditions as other employees under the relevant award. You can find awards and pay rates by using our

      Work records

     <p>
      Businesses need to make and keep a written record of what the business and outworker have agreed about the work being done.
     </p>
     <p>
      This record has to contain relevant details about the business, the outworker and the type of work required. Find out more about work records on the

     <h3>
      Written agreements
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a business enters a new arrangement with an outworker to carry out work, they have to complete a signed written agreement with the outworker. The agreement must set out if the work will be provided on a full-time or part-time basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the work will be provided on a part-time basis, the agreement will also need to include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the agreed number of hours of work per week
      </li>
      <li>
       if the hours will be averaged, the period over which the hours will be averaged, which can’t be more than four consecutive weeks.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The agreement has to also provide for wages and conditions no less than those contained in Schedule F of the Textile and Clothing Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agreement has to be clear and simple and in a language the worker understands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses have to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       give the outworker enough time to read and understand the agreement before it’s signed
      </li>
      <li>
       keep a copy of the agreement and any changes made to it.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The copies kept by the business must be in English.
