      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      hair and beauty salon’s attempt to cut costs by short-changing a teenage apprentice hairdresser $6400 has back-fired – with the operators being fined almost four times that amount for their conduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jack Younes, the former owner-operator of a Lattouf Hair and Day Spa franchise outlet at Castle Hill, has been penalised $4080, and his company Viper Industries Pty Ltd, a further $20,400.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney has issued Orders that the apprentice be back-paid all outstanding entitlements in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      An apprentice hairdresser at Younes’s business was underpaid a total of $6471 - including minimum wages, penalty rates and leave entitlements - between July, 2012, and October, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apprentice was aged 18 and 19 at the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the underpayment when they investigated a complaint from the young employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      In April last year, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice to Younes and his company requiring the underpayment to be rectified within 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, there was no response to the Notice or a follow-up letter in June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman was left with no option but to launch legal action, resulting in the Court imposing fines against Younes and his company.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has previously received several complaints from young workers employed by Younes - and had contacted him on at least 35 occasions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Sylvia Emmett said the company had demonstrated a reckless disregard for its workplace obligations to its staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says her Agency seeks to work with employers to resolve issues co-operatively, but will consider enforcement action when employers refuse to engage with inspectors.
