      <strong>

     <p>
      Twelve truck drivers at a
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      transport business have been back-paid a total of $93,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were underpaid the cents-per-kilometre rates they were entitled to for long-distance trips over a 12-month period in 2011-2012 as a result of their employer not applying the correct minimum rates when calculating their pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the case highlights the importance of employers being fully aware of minimum wages and entitlements that apply to their employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      "If left unchecked over time, a small underpayment can result in a hefty bill when discovered - a bill that most small business have not budgeted for," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries around Perth include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $10,000 for a worker at a
       <strong>
        Mindarie
       </strong>
       business not paid his final wages upon termination of employment last year,
      </li>
      <li>
       $6600 for a chef at a
       <strong>
        Perth CBD
       </strong>
       hotel not paid overtime rates for the additional hours he worked over a two-year period between 2011 and 2013,
      </li>
      <li>
       $6000 for an administration manager at a
       <strong>
        West Perth
       </strong>
       -based company not paid her redundancy entitlements upon termination of employment last year, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5600 for an assistant at a
       <strong>
        Hamilton Hill
       </strong>
       business not paid redundancy entitlements upon termination of her employment last year.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says that in each, employees were back-paid all money owed without the need for further action after Fair Work Inspectors contacted the employers and explained their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We're satisfied the underpayments were inadvertent," she said, "and our Inspectors assisted the employers to voluntarily rectify the underpayments and helped them put processes in place to ensure they comply with workplace laws in the future."
     </p>
     <p>
