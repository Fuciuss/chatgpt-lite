     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has won judicial support for the first review of a compliance notice.  The compliance notice was issued on a religious organisation in Melbourne, which was found to have underpaid an overseas worker almost $80,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The case involves an Indian man, aged in his 40s, who was sponsored by the Hindu Society of Victoria on a 428 religious worker visa to come to Australia to work at its Melbourne temple, located at
      <strong>
       Carrum Downs
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker was employed by the Hindu Society of Victoria at the temple from June 2011 until November 2012, when he severely injured his hand on a flour-grinder while performing cooking duties in the temple's canteen.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the worker subsequently lodged an underpayment allegation, the Fair Work Ombudsman investigated and determined the worker had performed a significant amount of work in the temple's canteen for which he was entitled to have been paid the minimum entitlements for a grade one cook under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      This included minimum hourly rates of more than $16.50 and $17 an hour, plus penalty rates of between $20.71 and $41.43 an hour for weekend, public holiday and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman determined that the Hindu Society of Victoria had paid the worker less than $15 an hour for 2823.5 hours of work and nothing at all for a further 2014.5 hours of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman issued the organisation a Compliance Notice requiring it to back-pay the worker a total of $77,754.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Hindu Society of Victoria lodged an application in the Federal Circuit Court challenging the Notice. This is the first time an employer's application to review a Compliance Notice in Court has proceeded to determination.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a significant interlocutory ruling during the course of the case, Judge Grant Riethmuller found that when contesting a Compliance Notice in Court, the employer bares the onus of proving they have paid employees correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The employer is uniquely positioned with respect to the production of evidence to demonstrate that the allegations in the compliance notice are not correct," Judge Riethmuller said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "In the event that the employer is keeping records as required under the regulations, one would expect that these would be relatively easy matters to prove."
     </p>
     <p>
      In the substantive hearing, the Hindu Society of Victoria submitted that the Fair Work Ombudsman's assessment was wrong and the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      did not apply - but Judge Riethmuller has now dismissed the argument, which means the Hindu Society of Victoria must now back-pay the employee according to the Compliance Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      In his judgment, Judge Riethmuller noted that the annual gross revenue of the temple’s canteen was more than $280,000 during the Indian worker’s employment and had subsequently increased to more than $600,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The takings of the canteen and the extent of its work (particularly with catering) makes it clear that the canteen had significantly outgrown a purely religious service," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that the Agency will continue to use Compliance Notices to secure back-payment for underpaid employees outside of the Courts, saving significant resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Compliance Notices will continue to be an efficient and effective tool precisely because they enable us to secure back-payment for underpaid employees without the cost to the public purse associated with appearing in Court," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman identifies more than $20 million in underpayments at thousands of Australian businesses each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The large majority of these cases are resolved through the Fair Work Ombudsman working co-operatively with employers to assist them to voluntarily back-pay employees and put processes in place to ensure ongoing compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, in a minority of cases in which employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work Inspectors have the power to issue a Compliance Notice demanding back-payment within a short time frame, such as 14 or 28 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says: "We will continue to issue Compliance Notices in situations where, after careful consideration of available evidence, we are satisfied that an employee has been underpaid – but the employer is refusing to co-operate and back-pay the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We respect the right of any employer who believes we have erred to contest a Compliance Notice in Court – but employers pursuing this avenue should note that they must be ready to present evidence to prove they have paid employees correctly."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers should also note that simply ignoring a Compliance Notice is a contravention of the Fair Work Act and can result in an employer facing a penalty, in addition to having to comply with the Compliance Notice and back-pay employees in full.

      Late last year, a Sydney cleaning operator was penalised more than $11,000 in Court for refusing to comply with a Compliance Notice issued by the Fair Work Ombudsman requiring it to back-pay two international students less than $3000 (see:
