       The former operator of a
       <strong>
        Melbourne
       </strong>
       hair and beauty business has been penalised $5100 for ignoring a Fair Work Commission order to compensate an employee who had been unfairly dismissed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Maria Raimondi, who formerly operated the Raimondi Hair and Day Spa at
       <strong>
        Eltham
       </strong>
       , has received the penalty in the Federal Circuit Court.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The penalty is the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 2014, the Fair Work Commission ordered Raimondi’s company to pay $6050 compensation to a hairdresser it found had been unfairly dismissed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after receiving a request for assistance from the employee when compensation was not paid within the required 14 days.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman made several requests for Raimondi’s company to comply with the Commission’s Order, but the compensation was not paid.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It was paid only after the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced litigation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says her Agency has an important role to play in enforcing Orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Building a culture of compliance with workplace law is important, and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The integrity of the system must be upheld.”
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The penalties against Raimondi represent the fourth time the Fair Work Ombudsman has secured penalties in Court against a business operator for ignoring a Fair Work Commission order to pay compensation to an unfairly dismissed employee.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says her Agency is working hard to ensure a level playing field for employers who are doing the right thing and meeting their workplace obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We are committed to helping employers understand and comply with workplace laws, but operators who do not co-operate when we find a problem will face enforcement action,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about their workplace practices to
