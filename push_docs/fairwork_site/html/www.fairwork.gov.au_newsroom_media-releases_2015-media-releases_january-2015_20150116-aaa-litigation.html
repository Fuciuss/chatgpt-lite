      A national
      <strong>
      </strong>
      glass repair business is facing Court for allegedly ignoring a Fair Work Commission order to compensate an employee who had been unfairly dismissed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against AAA Aussie Emergency Glass Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      In August, the Fair Work Commission ordered the company to pay $8000 compensation to a
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      -based sales and marketing employee it found had been unfairly dismissed last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated when the employee lodged a complaint after the compensation was not paid within the required 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman made several requests for the company to comply with the Commission’s Orders, but the company did not pay the compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business to try to resolve the matter, but were not able to secure co-operation,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation remains unpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says her Agency has an important role to play in enforcing orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Building a culture of compliance with workplace law is important, and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      AAA Aussie Emergency Glass faces a maximum penalty of $51,000 and the Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking an additional Court Order for the company to pay the outstanding compensation to the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne for January 27.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is one of a number of Fair Work Ombudsman litigations alleging breaches of a Fair Work Commission Order to pay unfair dismissal compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the one case that has been finalised, Melbourne company World Gym Sunshine Pty Ltd and its director Wayne George Mailing were fined almost $50,000 in September, 2014 for ignoring an order to pay $2200 compensation to a young employee (see:
