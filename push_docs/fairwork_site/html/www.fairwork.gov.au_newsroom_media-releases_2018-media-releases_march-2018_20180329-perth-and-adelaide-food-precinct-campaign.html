      The Fair Work Ombudsman has conducted a series of surprise visits to cafes, restaurants and bars in
      <strong>
       Adelaide
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      , checking businesses’ compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the past two days, Fair Work Inspectors have targeted businesses in Perth’s
      <strong>
       Northbridge
      </strong>
      area as well as popular strips in and around the Adelaide CBD, including
      <strong>
       Rundle Street
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Gouger and Grote Streets
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       North Adelaide
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       The Parade
      </strong>
      in
      <strong>
       Norwood.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In total, approximately 50 businesses received spot-checks, with inspectors checking workplace records and speaking to workers, managers and businesses owners.
     </p>

      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that the activities were launched in response to intelligence suggesting potential non-compliance among businesses in these areas, and follow similar audits targeting eateries in

      and

      The intelligence pointed to a culture of workers being paid flat rates below the minimum wage and a prevalence of cash-in-hand payments, indicating a potential lack of records being kept.
     </p>
     <p>
      “These precincts have a high density of hospitality businesses, which employ large numbers of young workers and visa-holders,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We know that these cohorts may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace due to a lack of experience and a limited awareness of workplace rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      “In addition, these businesses are operating in a highly competitive and price-driven market, increasing the potential for some businesses to adopt unlawful practices such as cost-cutting through underpaying wages to obtain a competitive advantage.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that while the visits served as a valuable opportunity for inspectors to provide advice and assistance to employers to help them comply with their obligations, businesses should also be aware that serious breaches can attract enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “These spot-checks will uncover any instances of non-compliance in these precincts and help to create a level playing field for businesses by ensuring employers are aware of and fully abide by their workplace obligations,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The hospitality industry is a major focus for the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Last financial year, the hospitality industry accounted for the highest number of formal requests for assistance and highest number of anonymous reports received by my agency,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I continue to urge workers to speak out if they have any concerns about their employment and need some assistance or advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Members of the community who wish to remain anonymous can use our anonymous report tool at
      <a href="http://www.fairwork.gov.au/tipoff">
