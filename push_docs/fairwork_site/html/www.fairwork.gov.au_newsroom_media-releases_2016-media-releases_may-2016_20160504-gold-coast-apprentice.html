      A
      <strong>
       Gold Coast
      </strong>
      apprentice paid less than $10 an hour has been reimbursed thousands of dollars following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The female apprentice was paid a flat rate of just $9.21 an hour for most of her employment with a local firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      She contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman seeking assistance after her requests to be paid the lawful minimum wage were rebuffed by her employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors subsequently determined that as a first-year adult apprentice, the worker was entitled to a minimum of $15.71 an hour on weekdays, $17.67 for early morning shifts, $23.56 on Saturdays, $31.42 on Sundays and $39.27 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result, she was short-changed more than $17,000 over almost 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer told Fair Work inspectors he was unaware adult apprentices were entitled to a higher pay rate than juniors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business has now been educated about its workplace obligations and the need to pay minimum wage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Employers must take steps to understand the Award/s that cover their business and the penalties that apply to the hours of work," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that given the employer co-operated, agreed to repay all money owed and ensure ongoing compliance with its obligations, it avoided further enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
