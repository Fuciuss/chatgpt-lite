     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against the operator of two ‘French Baguette Café’ outlets, located at
      <strong>
       Footscray
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Richmond
      </strong>
      in Melbourne.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is the company that operates the cafes, Saveway Store Pty Ltd, and the company’s sole director, Mr Son Thanh Nguyen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that the company and Mr Nguyen breached the Fair Work Act by failing to comply with a Compliance Notice requiring the company to calculate and back-pay any outstanding amounts owing to a number of cafe employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors commenced an investigation into the French Baguette outlets in 2019 as part of an auditing campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice was issued after a Fair Work Inspector formed a belief that full-time and part-time café employees had been underpaid overtime rates and weekend and public holiday penalty rates under the Restaurant Industry Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors issued Saveway Store Pty Ltd with a Compliance Notice requiring the business to calculate and rectify the alleged underpayments and produce reasonable evidence of its compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker says compliance notices are an important tool to recover unpaid wages for workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, inspectors can issue a compliance notice if they have a belief that an employer has breached certain workplace laws. Where employers do not comply with our notices, a court can order them to pay penalties in addition to back-paying any affected employees.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Fair Work Ombudsman is cracking down on alleged non-compliance in the fast food, restaurant and café sector. We will continue to utilise our full suite of enforcement tools to hold employers to account,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      A breach of pay slip laws is also alleged against Saveway Store Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is seeking penalties against Saveway Store Pty Ltd and Mr Nguyen. The company faces a maximum penalty of $31,500 for the Compliance Notice matter and $63,000 for the pay slip matter, while Mr Nguyen faces a maximum penalty of $6,300 for the Compliance Notice matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a Court Order requiring the company and Mr Nguyen to take the action required by the Compliance Notice, including calculating any underpayments and rectifying them in full, plus superannuation and interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing has been listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne for 18 February 2020.
