       Small business owners in regional South Australia will have the opportunity to engage with experts from the Fair Work Ombudsman next month as part of the SA Small Business Commissioner’s Bizlinks South-East Roadshow.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers will have the chance to hear from and speak directly to local, state and federal government organisations at events in
       <strong>
        Victor Harbor
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Murray Bridge
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors will provide tips for small business owners and demonstrate how to use some of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s online tools and resources.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The events will also provide employers with an opportunity to ask questions and seek advice during one-on-one conversations.
      </span>

       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is important that businesses, particularly small businesses, know that they can seek assistance if they are unsure of their obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “The Fair Work Ombudsman is striving to build a culture of compliance where businesses understand and comply with their lawful obligations,” she says.

       Earlier this year the Agency recovered $22,000 for a receptionist and shop assistant on the Fleurieu Peninsula who was underpaid her minimum hourly rate for almost seven years: see

       The Fair Work Ombudsman has a suite of tools and resources at
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
       that small business owners can tap into, including a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT), templates for time-and-wages records, an award-winning Online Learning Centre and staff management aids such as the Hiring Employees Guide.
