      How annual leave accumulates
     </h2>
     <p>
      Annual leave accumulates from the first day of employment, even if an employee is in a probation period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The leave accumulates gradually during the year and any unused annual leave will roll over from year to year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Annual leave accumulates when an employee is on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       paid leave such as:
       <ul>
        <li>
         paid annual leave
        </li>
        <li>
         paid sick and carer's leave
        </li>
        <li>
         paid family and domestic violence leave
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       community service leave including jury duty
      </li>
      <li>
       long service leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Annual leave doesn't accumulate when the employee is on:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       unpaid annual leave
      </li>
      <li>
       unpaid sick/carer's leave
      </li>
      <li>
       unpaid parental leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Australian Government's Paid Parental Leave Scheme isn't considered to be paid leave. An employee doesn't accumulate annual leave while being paid by the Paid Parental Leave Scheme if the person is taking unpaid leave from their employer at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leave doesn't accumulate for a period of annual leave that has been cashed out.
