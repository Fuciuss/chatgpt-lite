      <strong>
       26 June 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has taken the rare step of seeking an injunction restraining a retail operator from underpaying her employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The move – in the Federal Circuit Court – comes after the Agency received further complaints from young, vulnerable workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing legal action is Melbourne woman Deborah Ruth Souris, who owned and ran Kenny’s Cardiology and Giftology House specialty card and giftware stores in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Brisbane
      </strong>
      , before selling the Kenny’s Cardiology stores in 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Souris allegedly failed to respond to three Compliance Notices requesting back-pay for five former employees who had been underpaid a total of $11,187.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Fair Work Ombudsman is successful with the injunction, Ms Souris could potentially face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayments proven in Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The injunction is being sought in response to concerns that complaints from employees of businesses Ms Souris has been involved in suggest a pattern of non-compliant behaviour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 2007, the Fair Work Ombudsman has been contacted by more than 40 employees concerned about underpayment of wages who worked for companies of which Ms Souris was a director.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter is listed for a directions hearing in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on July 23.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is only the second time the Fair Work Ombudsman has sought such an injunction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first case was successful, with the Federal Circuit Court penalising NSW hair dressing salon operator Nelvin Litesh Lal and his businesses $162,000 for underpaying staff, and issuing an Order restraining Lal from underpaying any hairdressing employees in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that a manager at a store previously operated by Ms Souris in the Brisbane CBD was allegedly underpaid $7190.
     </p>
     <p>
      Four other employees at stores in
      <strong>
       Narre Warren
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Cheltenham
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Maribyrnong
      </strong>
      , in Melbourne, were also underpaid smaller amounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they wish to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with Ms Souris before placing the matter before Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Unfortunately, we were not able to secure sufficient co-operation and the alleged underpayments have not been rectified,” she said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Souris is facing maximum penalties of $5100 per contravention for three alleged contraventions of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order that any penalties be paid to the employees to rectify the alleged underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a range of free tools available at www.fairwork.gov.au to help employers comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to assist employers and employees determine the correct award and minimum wages for their industry, templates for time-and-wages records and an Online Learning Centre with free interactive courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are also Best Practice Guides on a range of topics, including an employer’s guide to employing young workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
