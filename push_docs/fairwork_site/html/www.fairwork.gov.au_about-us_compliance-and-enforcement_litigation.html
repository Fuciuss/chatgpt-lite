      If the employer is a company, we can take the company to court, but we can also take a person to court if they were 'involved in' the company’s contravention. A person involved in the company’s contravention may include:

      Serious contraventions

     <p>
      A serious contravention happens when the court finds that:
     </p>
     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>
       the person or business knew they were contravening an obligation under workplace laws
      </li>
      <li>
       the contravention was part of a systematic pattern of conduct affecting one or more people.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The higher penalties for serious contraventions apply to breaches of:

     <p>
      If an employer doesn't meet their record-keeping or pay slip obligations, and can't give a reasonable excuse, they will need to disprove allegations in wage claims made in a court. This is sometimes referred to as a 'reverse onus of proof.'

      If an employee makes a claim for breach of one or more of the above obligations and the employer didn’t keep the right records, make those records available, or give them a pay slip, the employer needs to prove that they did pay the employee correctly or gave them the right entitlements.
