      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against a
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      labour-hire operator who allegedly paid an overseas worker nothing for almost three months of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing the Federal Circuit Court is Leonard Greenan, of
      <strong>
       Mount Martha
      </strong>
      , whose business trades as 'United Consulting' and places employees in the automotive industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors investigated after receiving an underpayment allegation from a Pakistani worker Mr Greenan had employed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee, aged 26, was in Australia on a subclass 572 vocational education visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Greenan supplied the employee to work as a mechanic at a Renault dealership in
      <strong>
       Richmond
      </strong>
      between January and March last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that inspectors determined that despite the dealership paying Mr Greenan for supplying the worker, Mr Greenan failed to pay the worker any wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      In documents filed in Court, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Mr Greenan failed to comply with a Compliance Notice issued by an inspector requiring him to back-pay the worker a total of $7066 in outstanding wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must adhere to Compliance Notices or make a Court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record-keeping laws were allegedly also contravened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made extensive efforts to resolve the matter by agreement, but did not receive sufficient co-operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are prepared to take legal action against employers who refuse to engage with us and we treat matters involving overseas workers particularly seriously," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Greenan faces maximum penalties of up to $5400 per contravention for two alleged contraventions of the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the penalties, the Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking Court Orders requiring Mr Greenan to comply with the Compliance Notice by back-paying the worker in full and to register with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s My Account portal and complete all education courses for employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A default judgment hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on June 14.
