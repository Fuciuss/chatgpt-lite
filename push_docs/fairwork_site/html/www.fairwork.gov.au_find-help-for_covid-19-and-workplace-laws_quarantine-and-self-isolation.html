This means that an employee can't be dismissed or injured in their employment if they need to quarantine or self-isolate to avoid the risk of spreading the virus in the workplace. Find out more about

      Taking sick or carer's leave
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employee is sick with COVID-19 or needs to care for a family or household member, they may be able to take paid or unpaid sick or carer’s leave.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Full-time and part-time employees
     </h3>
     <p>
      Full-time and part-time employees can take paid sick leave if they can’t work because they’re sick with COVID-19. They can also take paid carer’s leave when they need to look after an immediate family or household member who is sick with COVID-19 or has an unexpected emergency. If they don’t have any paid sick or carer’s leave left, they can take 2 days of unpaid carer’s leave on each occasion. See

      Casual employees aren’t entitled to paid sick or carer’s leave. They are paid a casual loading instead of accumulating paid leave entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Casuals who need to care for an immediate family member or household member who is sick can take 2 days of unpaid carer’s leave on each occasion. Notice and evidence requirements can apply. See
