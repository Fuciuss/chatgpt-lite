      The Fair Work Ombudsman will commence audits of about 600 fast food outlets across the country this month as part of a national campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors will check employers are paying employees their minimum entitlements, including minimum hourly rates, penalty rates and overtime rates, and are complying with their record-keeping and pay slip obligations.

      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the fast food sector was being focused on because it employs a large number of young workers and generates a significant number of complaints to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Young workers can be vulnerable if they aren't aware of their workplace rights or are reluctant to complain, so itâ€™s important we are proactive about checking they are receiving their full lawful entitlements," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the campaign, the Fair Work Ombudsman wrote to more than 7,000 fast food operators in October last year to highlight the free resources at
      <a href="/how-we-will-help/helping-the-community/campaigns/national-campaigns/hospitality-campaign">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/fastfood
      </a>
      to help them comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The focus on fast food businesses is the third stage of a wider three-year campaign looking at wages and conditions in the hospitality industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the industry-wide campaign, the Fair Work Ombudsman focused similar educational activities on accommodation providers, pubs, taverns and bars in 2012 and on cafes, restaurants and caterers last year.
