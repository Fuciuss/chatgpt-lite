      Our services
     </h3>
     <p>
      We provide our services through:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       our website – www.fairwork.gov.au – the first point of contact for information and advice about Australia’s workplace relations system
      </li>
      <li>
       Fair Work Infoline – speak to one of our helpful advisers by calling 13 13 94 between 8am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday
      </li>
      <li>
       our staff and Fair Work Inspectors.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We don’t provide legal advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Register for
      <a href="/my-account/">
       My account
      </a>
      to access personalised workplace information and resources, and ask us general questions about your workplace rights and obligations. By registering for My account, you can:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       receive general information about workplace laws, minimum employment conditions and entitlements
      </li>
      <li>
       save personalised Pay, Shift, Leave and Notice and Redundancy results and calculations from our
       <a href="https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/">
        Pay and Conditions Tool
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       keep up to date with industry and award changes.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We also undertake educational activities and campaigns and provide information services, best practice guides and general educational information to the public. These services and campaigns are run at national, state and local levels and can target specific industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      If someone believes that they haven't received their minimum entitlements at work they can lodge a request for assistance with us. When we receive a request for assistance, we make an assessment about the best way to deal with it. We find that in most situations employees and employers can resolve their workplace issues by relying on our educational resources or dispute resolution services. In circumstances where breaches of workplace laws have significant consequences, are of public interest or relate to
      <a href="/about-us/our-role-and-purpose/our-priorities/default">
       Our priorities
      </a>
      , we can decide to conduct formal investigations that can lead to compliance and enforcement outcomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further information about how the FWO delivers its services to promote and monitor compliance with workplace laws is outlined in the Compliance and Enforcement Policy, available on the
      <a href="/about-us/accountability/our-policies">
       Our policies
      </a>
      page.
     </p>
     <p>
      If someone believes they have information and is concerned someone isn’t following workplace laws but they don’t wish to get involved directly, they can make an anonymous report in
      <a href="/workplace-problems/fixing-a-workplace-problem/report-an-issue-anonymously">
       English
      </a>
      and in
      <a href="/workplace-problems/fixing-a-workplace-problem/workplace-help-in-other-languages/report-a-workplace-issue-in-your-language">
       various other languages
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      In these circumstances, we won’t contact customers but information will be used to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       help us plan current and future education and enforcement activities
      </li>
      <li>
       where appropriate, share with other Commonwealth, State and Territory bodies to help with the administration or enforcement of a law.
      </li>
     </ul>

      The reliability of our advice depends on you providing accurate and complete information at the time of your enquiry. Our advice is based on the relevant legislation and existing case law at the time of our advice.
     </p>
     <p>

     <ul>
      <li>
       will not pursue a penalty for not paying the correct entitlements before the person is advised of the mistake
      </li>
      <li>
       will assist in any dispute to resolve concerns about outstanding entitlements
      </li>
      <li>
       may require that outstanding entitlements be paid and that correct entitlements are paid once the incorrect advice is identified
      </li>
      <li>
       will accept legal liability for the consequences which are caused by our incorrect advice in accordance with the law and the Legal Services Directions 2017 (Cth).
