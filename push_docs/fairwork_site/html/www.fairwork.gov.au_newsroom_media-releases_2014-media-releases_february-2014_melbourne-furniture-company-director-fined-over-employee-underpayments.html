      <strong>
       21 February 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former director of a Melbourne furniture company has been fined almost $30,000 for his part in underpaying two employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has imposed a penalty of $28,512 against Siu Kit Chan following legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chan was sole director and majority owner of
      <strong>
       Montmorency
      </strong>
      -based furniture importation and wholesaling company Iwood Australia before it went into liquidation last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty follows an admission by Chan that he was involved in underpaying two employees, aged in their 20s, a total of $12,704.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge John O’Sullivan has ordered that part of the fine be paid directly to the employees to rectify the underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the underpaid employees was a Malaysian national in Australia on a bridging visa who worked as an administrative assistant.
     </p>
     <p>
      She was underpaid $9459 in 2010-2011 as a result of being underpaid her minimum hourly rate, casual loading, leave entitlements, overtime rates, weekend penalty rates and public holiday pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other affected employee - a Melbourne man who worked in the company’s warehouse - was underpaid $3245 last year as a result of being underpaid annual leave entitlements and not being paid any wages for 94 hours of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the alleged underpayments when it investigated complaints lodged by the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says extensive efforts were made to resolve the issue without going to Court but legal action was ultimately commenced following a lack of co-operation from Chan.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This Court penalty sends a clear message that underpaying employees, particularly vulnerable foreign workers, and then failing to promptly rectify the matter is not acceptable and will not be tolerated," Ms James said.
