      <strong>
       17 March 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against the former owner-operator of a Sydney pizza outlet for allegedly failing to comply with a demand to back-pay eight underpaid employees more than $25,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing court is Sydney man Soitiros Theocharidis, who formerly owned and ran the Crust Gourmet Pizza outlet at
      <strong>
       Maroubra
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Eight delivery drivers and sales employees at the pizza outlet - including two aged under 21 - were allegedly underpaid a total of $25,995 in wages last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the alleged underpayments when they audited the business as part of a proactive auditing campaign targeting the fast food sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last September, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice to Mr Theocharidis and his private company that required the underpayments to be rectified within 29 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Theocharidis and his company allegedly failed to meet the requirements of the Compliance Notice, and no application for a review of the Compliance Notice was made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business operator to try to resolve the matter voluntarily, but were not been able to secure sufficient co-operation," Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Theocharidis faces maximum penalty of $5100.
     </p>
     <p>
      A hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney on April 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each year, Fair Work inspectors identify underpayments at thousands of businesses nationally and resolve the vast majority by working co-operatively with employers, guiding them through the back-payment process and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they pay their staff correctly in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work inspectors will consider compliance action, including issuing statute-based Compliance Notices, which usually seek action within 28 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is important for employers to understand that when a Compliance Notice is issued, the Fair Work Ombudsman is simply seeking to recover wages that should have been paid in the first instance - we are not seeking to be punitive," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Compliance Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      In February, the Fair Work Ombudsman announced it had commenced legal proceedings against two employers in
      <strong>
       Queensland
      </strong>
      and two in
      <strong>
       Victoria
      </strong>
      for allegedly failing to take action after being issued with Compliance Notices late last year.

      Ms James says supporting small business with information and advice on workplace laws is a high priority for the Agency.
     </p>

      "We are striving to provide accessible, credible and reliable information, focusing our resources quite deliberately at times on the sectors we believe need the most assistance," she said.
