       Information about the main industry of your business.

      Steps to take
     </h3>
     <p>
      <strong>
       1. Work out if the business is covered by an award
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Awards won’t apply to a business covered by a

        Awards
       </a>
       apply to employees and employers depending on the industry they work in and the job they do.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <strong>
       2. Read the award in more detail for clarification
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       In some cases, awards may be similar and it can be difficult deciding which one applies. For example, there are three awards that could apply to a business in the hospitality, restaurant or takeaway industry - the Hospitality Award, the Restaurant Award, and the Fast Food Award.
      </li>
      <li>
       You can use
       <a href="/employment-conditions/awards/find-my-award/">
        Find my award
       </a>
       to help you work out which award applies to each employee based on the work they do.
      </li>
      <li>
       To read an award in more detail visit

        List of awards
       </a>
       . To work out if an award applies you should read:
       <ul>
        <li>
         the coverage clause (usually clause 4)
        </li>
        <li>
         the job classifications (check in a schedule at the bottom of the award).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       We also have award specific information you can search for in our

       3. If your business is covered by more than one award
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       A business may be covered by more than one award. Depending on the type of work your business and employees do, different awards could apply to different employees.
      </li>
      <li>
       For example, a construction business that is covered by the Building and Construction Award for their qualified carpenters may also be covered by the Clerks Award for their office staff.
      </li>
      <li>
       The award that applies will depend on the following:
       <ul>
        <li>
         the primary industry of the employer
        </li>
        <li>
         the classification most appropriate to the work performed by the employee and the industry in which they work
        </li>
        <li>
         where there is no award covering the industry, consider an award providing coverage for the specific occupation
        </li>
        <li>
         any exclusions listed in the award.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>

       Example: Which award applies?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Gerard runs a café that has seating for customers but also provides take away service. He’s not sure if he’s covered by the Restaurant Award or the Fast Food Award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gerard reads the coverage (clause 4) and definitions (clause 3) sections of both awards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fast Food Award says it covers businesses that sell food that is primarily consumed away from the point of sale. While Gerard does do some take away, most of his business is made up of customers who sit and eat at his café.
      </p>
      <p>
       He reads the Restaurant Award and can see that the definition of ‘restaurant industry’ includes cafés. Gerard is confident his business is covered by the Restaurant Award.
