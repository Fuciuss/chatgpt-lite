      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against the operators of the Chevron Tavern, located on the Gold Coast.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is the company that operates the sports bar, Chevron Island Tavern Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that the company breached the Fair Work Act by failing to comply with a Compliance Notice requiring the company to back-pay six employees a total of $13,417 over a seven-month period last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice also required the company to calculate any outstanding superannuation owing to the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors commenced an investigation into the Chevron Tavern last year after receiving a request for assistance from an employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice was issued earlier this year after a Fair Work Inspector formed a reasonable belief that kitchen and bar staff at the tavern had been underpaid weekend, night and public holiday penalty rates, casual loadings and overtime rates under the Hospitality Industry Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker says compliance notices are an important tool to recover unpaid wages for workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, inspectors can issue a compliance notice if they have a reasonable belief that an employer has breached workplace laws. Employers must comply with Compliance Notices unless they decide to challenge a notice in court.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “We will continue to utilise our full suite of enforcement tools to hold employers to account,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is seeking a penalty against Chevron Island Tavern Pty Ltd. The company faces a maximum penalty of $31,500.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a Court Order requiring the company to take the action required by the Compliance Notice, including back-paying the allegedly underpaid wages and calculating and back-paying any outstanding superannuation owing to the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing has been listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane for March 27, 2020.
