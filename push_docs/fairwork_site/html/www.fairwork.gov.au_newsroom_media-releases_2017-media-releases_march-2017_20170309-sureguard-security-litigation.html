       A
       <strong>
        Perth
       </strong>
       security company is facing Court for allegedly underpaying its guards more than $200,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against Sureguard Security Pty Ltd, based at
       <strong>
        Rockingham
       </strong>
       , alleging it underpaid 22 security guards a total of $205,408 between December, 2014 and January, 2016.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman conducted a self-initiated audit of Sureguard Security in October, 2015 as part of proactive campaign in Perth’s southern suburbs.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is alleged that Fair Work inspectors found that guards were paid flat hourly rates of between $21.50 and $24 for static guard work and $25 for patrol work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is alleged that this led to the workers being variously underpaid their minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, overtime pay and penalty rates for night, weekend and public holiday work under the
       <em>
        Security Services Industry Award
       </em>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman claims 13 of the guards worked permanent night shifts.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Alleged underpayments of individual workers range from $227 to $20,174.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the significant size of the underpayments and the failure to rectify the matter were key factors in the decision to commence litigation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The company faces maximum penalties of up to $54,000 per contravention for several alleged contraventions of workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court orders for the company to back-pay the workers in full and to commission workplace relations training for its managers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       An injunction restraining Sureguard Security from underpaying workers in future is also being sought. If
      </span>
      <span>
       the injunction is granted, the company could face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayment contraventions proven in court.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A directions hearing is scheduled in the Federal Court in Perth on 3 March.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says payment of flat rates leading to underpayments of guards is a persistent problem in the security industry and improving compliance in the industry will continue to be a focus for the Fair Work Ombudsman.
