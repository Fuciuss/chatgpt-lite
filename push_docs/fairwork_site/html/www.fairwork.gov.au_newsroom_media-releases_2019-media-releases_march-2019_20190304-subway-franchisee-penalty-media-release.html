      <strong>
       4 March 2019
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has secured $65,438 in penalties in Court against the former franchisee of two Subway outlets in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      for underpaying a Chinese worker more than $16,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court penalised Danmin Zhang $9,255 - who formerly operated Subway franchise outlets at
      <strong>
       Artarmon
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Stanmore
      </strong>
      . The company Ms Zhang and her husband operate, G &amp; Z United Pty Ltd, has been penalised a further $56,183.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors found the worker, a Chinese national, had been underpaid a total of $16,345 for work performed across both stores, after she was paid unlawful flat rates of $14 to $14.50 per hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fast Food Industry Award 2010
      </em>
      , she was entitled to receive minimum rates of more than $18, plus casual loading, for ordinary hours, and penalty rates of up to $52.22 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said the regulator investigated after the worker lodged a request for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is unlawful for employers to pay their employees low, flat rates that undercut minimum Award wage rates. This franchisee paid their worker a flat rate that was $4 below the lawful rate, and now faces paying a $65,000 penalty from the Court.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “The penalty should send a message to fast food businesses that compliance in the workplace is not an option - it’s the law. Every worker in Australia has the same workplace rights and we encourage anyone with concerns to contact the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The affected worker, a casual food and beverage attendant aged in her late 20s, was underpaid between October 2014 and April 2016. She was in Australia on a Skilled Nominated (subclass 190) visa at the time. The worker was back-paid in full in 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker was underpaid her minimum hourly rates for ordinary hours, casual loadings and penalty rates for evening, weekend and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      In imposing the penalties, Judge Julia Baird found that ensuring compliance with minimum standards was a very significant factor and the penalties imposed should send a message to the community and to employers of the importance of complying with their legal obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court found a special clothing allowance was also underpaid and laws relating to record-keeping, pay slips and requirements to inform employees about their terms of engagement and classification were also breached.
