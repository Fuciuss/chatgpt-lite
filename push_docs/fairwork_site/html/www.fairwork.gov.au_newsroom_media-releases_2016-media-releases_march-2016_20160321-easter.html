      The Fair Work Ombudsman is urging employers and employees to check the pay rates and entitlements that apply to their workplace over Easter.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whether you are a business operator preparing for Easter trading or an employee working through Easter, it's important to be aware of the public holidays and any penalty rates that apply," Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Our website can assist employers and workers alike understand and comply with their rights and obligations so there aren’t any issues arising post-Easter."
     </p>
     <p>
      Information available on
      <a href="/leave/public-holidays">
       the public holidays page
      </a>
      includes an overview of the workplace laws that apply on public holidays, including what employers need to pay and what employees are entitled to.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website also contains details of applicable public holidays in each state and territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Good Friday (March 25) and Easter Monday (March 28) are national public holidays, but in some states and territories, Easter Saturday and/or Easter Sunday are public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees and employers can use the Fair Work Ombudsman’s free online tools and resources to check entitlements specific to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) can provide information on pay, shift, penalty, leave and redundancy entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says most underpayments are inadvertent and the result of employers failing to check their minimum obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is important for employers to be fully aware of the minimum pay rates that apply to their employees, otherwise they can end up facing bills for back-payment of wages they were not budgeting for," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman was striving to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure an even playing field for all businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are committed to supporting compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply," Ms James said.
     </p>
