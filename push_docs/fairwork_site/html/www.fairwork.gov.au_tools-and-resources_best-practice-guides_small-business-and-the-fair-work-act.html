      Working at best practice
     </h2>
     <p>
      For small business owners and operators, working at best practice means understanding and meeting your obligations under Australian workplace laws. It also means going beyond these minimum requirements to help your employees and business thrive – and it is easier than you might think.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every workplace can enjoy the benefits of taking a best practice approach to employment, even small business. These can include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       improved ability to attract the best staff
      </li>
      <li>
       higher levels of staff performance and engagement
      </li>
      <li>
       lower turnover and hiring costs
      </li>
      <li>
       avoiding misunderstandings and disputes over employee entitlements
      </li>
      <li>
       easier implementation of workplace change
      </li>
      <li>
       improved ability to manage and grow the business.

     <h3>
      Awards
     </h3>
     <p>
      An award (also called a modern award) is a document that sets out the minimum wages and conditions for an industry or occupation. Awards usually have rules about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       which industry and occupations they cover
      </li>
      <li>
       pay
      </li>
      <li>
       work hours
      </li>
      <li>
       rosters
      </li>
      <li>
       leave and breaks
      </li>
      <li>
       allowances
      </li>
      <li>
       penalty rates
      </li>
      <li>
       overtime.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Awards apply in addition to the NES. A workplace can be covered by more than one award depending on the jobs that the employees do. Awards don’t apply to employees covered by a registered agreement (except that the base rate of pay in the agreement can’t be less than the base pay rate in the award).

     <h3>
      Registered Agreements
     </h3>
     <p>
      A registered agreement is a document that sets out employment conditions for a specific business. It’s made between the employer and employees through a bargaining process and is approved by the Fair Work Commission. The most common type of registered agreement is an enterprise agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like awards, registered agreements apply in addition to the NES, and they can’t provide for any terms which are less than what is contained in the NES.
     </p>
     <p>
      The base pay rate in the registered agreement also can’t be less than the base rate in the relevant award at any time. If it is, the employee must be paid at least the base award rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Registered agreements can benefit a business because they’re tailored to that workplace’s needs. The Fair Work Commission provides information on making agreements. Find out more on their

      Ending employment
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employer may dismiss an employee if they have a valid reason, such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       serious misconduct (theft, fraud, assault, sexual harassment or serious safety breaches)
      </li>
      <li>
       ongoing underperformance
      </li>
      <li>
       the job is no longer needed (redundancy).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers need to follow a fair process when they dismiss an employee. They should keep a record of the process and the reason for the dismissal. Employees should know the reason for their dismissal and be given an opportunity to respond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses with less than 15 employees have special rules for ending employment. This means:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       small business employers don’t have to pay redundancy pay (in most cases)
      </li>
      <li>
       that an employee can only make an unfair dismissal claim if they have worked for the small business employer for 12 months or more
      </li>
      <li>
       small business employers are exempt from unfair dismissal claims, where they follow the

      </li>
      <li>
       for engaging in lawful industrial activity

      <li>
       because they have exercised a workplace right (like being a member of a union)

       for making a complaint or inquiry related to their employment, such as asking about a pay rate or contacting the Fair Work Ombudsman

      If the employee believes they were dismissed for one of these reasons, they can make a ‘general protections’ claim or an ‘unlawful termination’ claim against the employer. These are different from ‘unfair dismissal’ claims and small businesses are not exempt from these types of claims. To find out more, visit the

      Using best practice in your small business
     </h2>
     <p>
      All employers must comply with their legal obligations, but there are many things you can do to make your business ‘best practice’ – that is, a great place to work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Best practice doesn’t look the same for all employers. The way to achieve best practice will vary because of things like the number of employees, industry and the business environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Below are initiatives and suggestions that can help you move your business towards best practice.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Build a positive workplace culture
     </h3>
     <p>
      Workplace culture is about the behaviour that people expect and accept in a workplace. It’s the way people communicate with each other and the way people go about doing their work. Businesses with a positive culture tend to have low staff turnover, low absenteeism and more motivated employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Best practice employers create a positive workplace culture by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       setting fair and clear expectations
      </li>
      <li>
       acknowledging people’s differences and the value these differences bring to the business
      </li>
      <li>
       building trust through acting honestly, consistently and fairly
      </li>
      <li>
       inviting feedback and listening to employees
      </li>
      <li>
       taking an interest in employees’ career development
      </li>
      <li>
       providing training and coaching to help employees reach their goals
      </li>
      <li>
       modelling the work ethic, values and behaviours they want to see in their employees
      </li>
      <li>
       recognising and rewarding good performance
      </li>
      <li>
       being flexible where they can and understanding that employees have lives outside of work
      </li>
      <li>
       insisting that employees behave and communicate in a respectful way.
      </li>
     </ul>

     <h3>
      Engage and consult with employees
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees who are engaged in their work, and the business, tend to perform better and stay with their employer longer. Employees are more likely to be engaged, and motivated to work hard, if they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       know what the business’s goals are
      </li>
      <li>
       understand how their work contributes to the success of the business
      </li>
      <li>
       feel part of where the business is heading
      </li>
      <li>
       believe their ideas are heard and appreciated.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Best practice employers share information with their employees and create an environment where employees are comfortable contributing their ideas. They listen and encourage employees to share ownership of the business goals.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can work at best practice in your business by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       discussing the goals of the business with your employees
      </li>
      <li>
       sharing details about the performance of the business
      </li>
      <li>
       acknowledging that your employees’ experience and day-to-day work may give them valuable insights into your business that you don’t have
      </li>
      <li>
       encouraging employees to share their ideas, ask questions and raise concerns
      </li>
      <li>
       providing ways for employees to do this, such as a dedicated email address, a suggestions box, online forums and having an ‘open door’ policy
      </li>
      <li>
       discussing staff ideas and suggestions at regular team meetings
      </li>
      <li>
       involving employees in solving problems and business planning
      </li>
      <li>
       holding annual planning days to involve employees in setting business and team goals and targets for the following year.

      <h3>
       Practical Tip:
      </h3>
      <p>
       Employers may be reluctant to share business performance information with employees for several reasons. If the profit of the business is the owner’s direct income, they may see that as private. If the business is underperforming, they may not want to cause staff to fear for their jobs. If there is a lack of trust, they may worry about business information being disclosed or misused.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re reluctant to share information with your employees, consider providing less sensitive, non-financial data (such as the number of sales made this week, or clients seen this month). Sharing this information on a regular basis shows employees how the business is tracking and allows them to be more responsive to opportunities and challenges when they arise.
      </p>
     </div>
     <h3>
      Manage performance
     </h3>
     <p>
      Best practice employers give employees regular constructive feedback on their performance and help them continuously develop their skills. They implement simple performance systems, which allow them to set clear goals, communicate expectations, identify training needs and provide a framework for ongoing feedback and discussion.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can work at best practice by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       setting clear and achievable expectations
      </li>
      <li>
       meeting with employees to discuss and record their individual performance goals and training needs
      </li>
      <li>
       monitoring employees’ performance and providing regular specific feedback, both positive and constructive
      </li>
      <li>
       dealing with any performance issues as soon as they come up
      </li>
      <li>
       supporting employees to improve performance, for example through training, coaching and mentoring
      </li>
      <li>
       conducting a review with each employee every 6 or 12 months to assess their performance against the agreed goals and to set new goals
      </li>
      <li>
       creating a performance agreement template for your workplace and ensuring your employees have a performance agreement in place
      </li>
      <li>
       recognising and rewarding employees who do a good job. This doesn’t have to be a financial reward; many employees appreciate a simple acknowledgement.

     <h3>
      Be flexible
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees look for ways to balance work and other commitments, such as caring for children or elderly parents, study, sporting activities or other hobbies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Certain employees have a legal right to request flexible working arrangements. This may involve changes to work hours, patterns or locations (such as part-time work, changed start and finish times and working from home). Best practice employers go beyond the minimum legal requirements and offer flexibility to all employees to help them balance their work and personal lives.
     </p>

     </p>
     <h3>
      Implement workplace policies
     </h3>
     <p>
      Best practice employers put in place workplace policies to provide clarity to employees and managers, reinforce their workplace values and to help them comply with their legal obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Common issues covered in policies include leave, discrimination, bullying and harassment, workplace health and safety, social media, use of drugs and alcohol, flexibility, performance processes, discipline and termination of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Best practice employers may also use policies to provide benefits that go beyond minimum legal entitlements, for example, access to company vehicles or phones. Providing extra benefits doesn’t have to cost money, for example, making flexible work arrangements available to all employees or allowing employees to take additional annual leave at half pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even small businesses can benefit from implementing workplace policies. These don’t have to be long or complicated, they may simply record and clarify the practices you already have in your workplace. You can implement best practice workplace policies in your small business by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Involving staff in developing policies for your workplace. This will ensure your policies are tailored to the specific needs of your workplace, and that staff are able to understand and apply them
      </li>
      <li>
       Checking policies are easy to understand. Keep them short and use simple language
      </li>
      <li>
       Making policies accessible. Give copies to all new and existing staff and make paper or electronic copies available in the workplace
      </li>
      <li>
       Discussing policies in training and meetings to remind employees what is expected
      </li>
      <li>
       Asking managers and leaders to use and model workplace policies. This encourages other employees to take them seriously
      </li>
      <li>
       Reviewing policies regularly to ensure they are current and reflect any changes in the workplace or the law.
