      The Fair Work Ombudsman will meet with key members of the small business community at a roundtable in Melbourne tomorrow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tomorrow’s discussions follow a roundtable last March which "started a conversation" about how the Fair Work agencies can work together to support small business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forum will be co-hosted by Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James and Australian Small Business Commissioner Mark Brennan, whose role includes working with industry and government to promote a co-ordinated approach to small business matters.
     </p>
     <p>
      It will focus on “effective communication with small business” and “reducing the regulatory burden”, which were the key themes to come out of the March roundtable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says hearing directly from members of the small business community will help her agency to better understand how to support their needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We want to harness the expertise of key stakeholders in the small business community and hear from them how complying with workplace laws could be made simpler,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our first roundtable provided a platform to learn about the difficulties that some small businesses face, and now we want to have a discussion about the solutions.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Brennan says tomorrow’s forum provides an important opportunity to engage with industry and professional associations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “These associations are actively involved with small businesses and have a wealth of knowledge government can learn from to improve the small business operating environment,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We look forward to an open conversation with participants about their experience in communicating with small business and hearing their ideas for reducing the regulatory burden on small business.”
     </p>
