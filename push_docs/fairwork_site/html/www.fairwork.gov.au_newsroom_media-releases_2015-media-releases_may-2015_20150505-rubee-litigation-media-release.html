       An
       <strong>
        Albury
       </strong>
       café owner allegedly coerced two Indian workers into paying him thousands of dollars in cash in return for his support for their visas.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The two young workers faced the prospect of having to leave Australia within 28 days if the employer withdrew support for their visas.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James has put the matter before Court, expressing concern about the businessman’s alleged coercive behaviour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Facing legal proceedings is Fares Ghazale, now of Chirnside Park in Victoria, and his company Rubee Enterprises Pty Ltd.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Ghazale formerly owned and operated Albury’s Canteen Cuisine café until it closed last September.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Documents lodged in the Federal Court in Sydney allege that Mr Ghazale was involved in multiple breaches of workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Allegations in the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Statement of Claim include coercion, adverse action, providing false records and underpaying five employees more than $87,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges the five underpaid staff included two Indian workers in their late 20s employed as cooks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       One had been sponsored by Rubee Enterprises on a 457 skilled worker visa and the second had an application pending for the same visa.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The two cooks were allegedly paid a flat rate of $1000 and $830 respectively for working a 60-hour week, including nights and weekends.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This is significantly less than the minimum wage and penalty rates they were entitled to under Australia’s
       <em>
        Restaurant Industry Award 2010
       </em>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman claims the two employees were each underpaid amounts of $32,063 and $28,858.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, in addition to allegedly short-changing the workers, the Fair Work Ombudsman claims Mr Ghazale coerced the pair into going to a local ATM to withdraw cash and then repay him large amounts of their wage - threatening to withdraw his support for their visas if they refused
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       One employee was allegedly required to repay Mr Ghazale more than $11,000 over a period of several months in amounts ranging from $550 to $940 a week.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Similarly, it is alleged Mr Ghazale coerced the second Indian cook into repaying more than $10,000 cash through weekly repayments ranging from $200 to $700.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman says the employee complained that he was being exploited, but Mr Ghazale’s alleged response was to threaten to withdraw his support for a pending 457 visa application.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee allegedly subsequently told Mr Ghazale he could no longer surrender his weekly wages, to which Mr Ghazale allegedly responded by shouting at him and demanding $500 cash each week if he wanted to get the visa.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       At one point during this exchange, Mr Ghazale allegedly took hold of him by the collar. The alleged conduct was reported to Albury police.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is alleged the cook continued working at the café and provided cash on a weekly basis to Mr Ghazale.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       When the other cook allegedly complained about the repayment requests, Mr Ghazale allegedly threatened he would “contact Immigration” if the employee refused to hand over the cash.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In addition to the alleged underpayment of the Indian visa-holders, Fair Work inspectors allegedly found three Australian citizens employed at the café had also been underpaid their wages and entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman says a waitress was underpaid $11,273, a cook $8946 and an apprentice cook $6766.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Agency investigated after receiving a request for assistance from one of the employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Ghazale and Rubee Enterprises allegedly knowingly provided false time-and-wages records to Fair Work inspectors and failed to issue payslips to employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Ghazale faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Rubee Enterprises faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for the company to back-pay the workers in full.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says her Agency has placed the matter before Court because of the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the involvement of vulnerable overseas workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She says the Fair Work Ombudsman places a high priority on protecting the workplace rights of overseas workers, who can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or are reluctant to complain.
