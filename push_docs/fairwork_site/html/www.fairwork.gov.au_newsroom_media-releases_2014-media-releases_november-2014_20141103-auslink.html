      A security business breached workplace laws by failing to co-operate with inspectors investigating sham contracting allegations relating to Queensland workers, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is Victorian-based company Bona Group Pty Ltd, trading as Auslink Protective Services.
     </p>
     <p>
      After a security worker lodged a complaint, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced an investigation into possible sham contracting activity relating to a number of workers at Queensland locations including a
      <strong>
       Gold Coast
      </strong>
      light rail site.
     </p>
     <p>
      After attempts to secure voluntary co-operation from Auslink Protective Services were unsuccessful, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued the business with a Notice to Produce documents in April, requiring documents to be provided within 17 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company allegedly did not respond to either the Notice to Produce or a follow-up letter sent in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Notices to Produce issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made repeated efforts to engage with this business operator to try to obtain the documents required for our investigation, but were not able to secure sufficient co-operation,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company faces a penalty of up to $51,000 – and in addition, the Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking a Court Order for the company to comply with the Notice to Produce so its investigation can continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the proceedings are necessary because enforcing compliance with Notices to Produce is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws and enabling inspectors to conduct thorough investigations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for the matter in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane on November 10.
