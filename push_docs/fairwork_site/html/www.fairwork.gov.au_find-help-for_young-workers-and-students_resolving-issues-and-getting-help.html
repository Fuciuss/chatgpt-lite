       <li>
        the award or enterprise agreement that applies

      Gather supporting information
     </h4>
     <p>
      Before you speak to your manager, it’s a good idea to gather some supporting information so you can show them why you think there’s an issue. This may include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       your pay slip
      </li>
      <li>
       payment summaries or bank statements that show what you’ve been paid
      </li>
      <li>
       notes or records about hours of work, significant events, conversations and meetings
      </li>
      <li>
       the relevant parts of the award or enterprise agreement
      </li>
      <li>
       rosters and timesheets.

      Talk to your manager
     </h3>
     <p>
      We know that it can be uncomfortable to talk with your manager about a problem you may be having at work. Your manager may not realise there is a problem or that a mistake has been made until you bring it to their attention.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you don’t want to speak to your manager, think about whether you could speak to another senior person or a human resources officer.
