     <p>
      Three apprentice chefs at
      <strong>
       Coffs Harbour
      </strong>
      have been underpaid more than $22,000, investigations by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      An adult apprentice in his mid-20s working at a local café was short-changed $9500 over seven months.
     </p>
     <p>
      He was paid junior rates of $11 for normal hours and $16.50 on Sundays, but under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      was entitled to a normal rate of $15.71 and up to $23.57 on Sundays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also discovered that he was not paid any overtime, despite working up to 54 hours a week, and was not receiving paid meal breaks, annual leave or minimum engagement entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, inquiries by Fair Work inspectors have revealed that two other apprentice chefs at a local restaurant were short-changed almost $13,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were inadvertently underpaid weekend, public holiday and overtime rates over six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      And in a separate matter, the Fair Work Ombudsman has recovered $5400 for 13 employees at a local cleaning company who were underpaid early morning shift rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says Coffs Harbour businesses need to ensure they understand the wage rates applicable to their business, including penalty rates for overtime, weekend and evening shifts.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says minimum pay rates apply to all workers, are not optional and employers must know what they are.
     </p>

      Tools and resources available on the website include templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Agency is working hard to provide practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply to support compliant, productive and inclusive workplaces and build a culture of compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws.
