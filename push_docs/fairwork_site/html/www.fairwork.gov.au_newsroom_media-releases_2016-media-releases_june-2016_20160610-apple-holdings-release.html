      <strong>
       10 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Two overseas workers at a Japanese restaurant in Perth have been back-paid almost $14,000 after a Fair Work Ombudsman investigation revealed they had been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees, from Malaysia and Japan, were underpaid at the Senoji Japanese Restaurant in
      <strong>
       Victoria Park
      </strong>
      between July, 2014 and August, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors found that the two overseas workers, who were aged in their 20s and employed as kitchen-hands, were being paid a flat rate of about $16 for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      , the employees were entitled to receive rates of up to $18 for ordinary hours, $22 on Saturdays, $27 on Sundays, $36 for overtime work and $44 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      A split shift allowance, late-night penalty rates and minimum engagement entitlements were also underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The male Malaysian worker, in Australia on a student visa, was underpaid $8095.
     </p>
     <p>
      The female Japanese worker, who is on a spousal visa, was underpaid $5727.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company operating the restaurant, Apple Holdings Pty Ltd, claimed it was not aware of the minimum Award rates that applied to its employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apple Holdings co-operated with the Fair Work Ombudsman's investigation, back-paying the employees in full and paying an $850 Infringement Notice for failing to issue pay-slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company has also signed an Enforceable Undertaking with the Fair Work Ombudsman, requiring it to display a workplace notice detailing its contraventions, apologise to employees and commission an independent professional audit of its compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company must also provide evidence that it is using a range of educative resources for employers available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website and develop systems for ensuring future compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the undertaking aims to encourage behavioural change and future compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers must ensure they are aware of the minimum hourly rates and penalty rates that apply to their staff, and pay them accordingly.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Minimum rates apply to everyone – including visa-holders – and they are not negotiable," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty to visit the Fair Work Ombudsman website at www.fairwork.gov.au  or call the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94 for advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      An interpreter service is available by calling 13 14 50, and information on the website is translated into 27 languages.
