      About the Road Safety Remuneration System
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal) set pay and conditions for road transport drivers in the road transport industry.
     </p>

      The Road Safety Remuneration System was created by the Road Safety Remuneration Act 2012, and was repealed by the Road Safety Remuneration Repeal Act 2016.

      Under the Road Safety Remuneration Repeal Act 2016, the Road Safety Remuneration Act 2012 (including the Tribunal that it established and the Orders that the Tribunal made) ceased to operate at 12am on Thursday 21 April 2016.
