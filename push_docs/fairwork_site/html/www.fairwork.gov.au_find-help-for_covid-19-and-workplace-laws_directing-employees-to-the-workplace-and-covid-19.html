      that applies, employers and employees have to follow it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers can require (or direct) their employees to work their normal hours as long as the employee isn’t on approved leave and the requirement is lawful and reasonable. This includes requiring the employee to return to the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where possible, employers should continue exploring alternative working arrangements in their workplace, particularly while social distancing rules or COVID-19 vaccination requirements apply. Examples include supporting different types of work from home arrangements or changing the patterns of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers also need to comply with their work health and safety and other legal obligations, as well as employees’ usual employment conditions.

      When employees refuse to return to work or their workplace

     <p>
      An employee can’t refuse an employer’s direction to perform work if the direction is reasonable and in line with their employer’s legal obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some circumstances, employees may be able to refuse to return to work because of a reasonable concern about their health and safety or another legitimate reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers need to make sure they meet all workplace health and safety (WHS) obligations.

      If an employee’s refusal to return to the workplace relates to COVID-19 vaccinations, we can provide general guidance on how vaccination issues interact with laws under the Fair Work Act. Learn more at

      When an employee doesn’t comply with a direction

     <p>
      Employers and employees are encouraged to work together to manage the return to the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee has concerns about the safety of the workplace, they should raise their concerns with their employer as soon as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers should consider sharing information about any steps they’ve taken to ensure a safe workplace and to help manage employee concerns.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee doesn’t comply with their employer’s requirement to return to work or their usual workplace, their employer can take disciplinary action. In some circumstances, this could include termination of employment. Employers need to make sure they comply with the general protections and unfair dismissal obligations in the Fair Work Act.

      Alternative work arrangements when caring for a child
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employee can’t return to the workplace because they need to care for a child whose school or childcare centre has closed, they should come to an arrangement with their employer. This could include requesting to work from home or taking some form of leave, such as annual leave or long service leave. Normal leave application processes apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees also have the option to request flexible work arrangements in certain circumstances. For more information, see

     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee doesn't come to an arrangement to work from home with their employer, or doesn’t use paid leave, then they aren’t entitled to be paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees who need to care for a sick child can take carer’s leave (paid or unpaid). If a full-time or part-time employee has no paid carer’s leave left they can request to take unpaid carer’s leave. Unpaid carer’s leave is also available to casual employees, who are entitled to 2 days of leave per occasion. Learn more at
