      <strong>
       9 June 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A labour-hire operator in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      is facing Court for allegedly breaching sham contracting laws and underpaying two employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against Franco Cardamone, who operates a labour-hire business trading as Howsitgoingmate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Cardamone allegedly underpaid two workers a total of $1970 for short periods of various manual labouring work they completed in 2013 and 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments were allegedly the result of the casual employees being paid flat rates of $18 an hour, despite being entitled to more than $20 an hour for normal hours and rates of up to $36 an hour for overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged Mr Cardamone also breached sham contracting laws by knowingly misclassifying one of the employees as a contractor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the workers contacted the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Cardamone and his company allegedly failed to respond to two Notices to Produce employment records issued by Fair Work inspectors during the investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Notices or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Breaches of pay-slip laws are also alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action was initiated because of a lack of co-operation from Mr Cardamone and because he has previously been put on notice of the need to comply with workplace relations laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has received more than 30 underpayment allegations from employees of businesses operated by Mr Cardamone since 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Mr Cardamone has been warned about the need to pay employees their full lawful entitlements and not to misclassify employees as contractors,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Cardamone faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention. The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Orders for full back-payment of the two employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is scheduled in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on July 7.
