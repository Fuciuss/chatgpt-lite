      Random audits of fruit and vegetable farms in Far North Queensland have revealed strong compliance with federal workplace laws, the Fair Work Ombudsman announced today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors visited 11 properties in the
      <strong>
       Atherton Tablelands
      </strong>
      region in December to ensure that seasonal workers were receiving their proper entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nine of the 11 (82 per cent) were found to be fully compliant with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors checked the books of banana, avocado, onion, mango and potato farms employing large numbers of overseas workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      On one farm, Fair Work inspectors found that 64 employees had not been paid superannuation entitlements totalling $54,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer agreed to back-pay the contributions, and the matter was referred to the Australian Taxation Office, which has jurisdiction over superannuation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate case, another employer was found to have short-changed 59 of its employees a total of $18,534 as a result of failing to pass on a minimum wage increase last July.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two properties also contravened workplace laws by failing to issue sufficiently detailed payslips to their workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the high compliance outcome is encouraging, but some employers still need to pay greater attention to pay rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said employers contacted by Fair Work inspectors appreciated the opportunity to better understand their obligations and the resources available to help them.
     </p>
     <p>
      One employer wrote a follow-up letter, stating: "Thank you for your time, it was a very efficient procedure and it is welcoming to know that your agency is here to help."
     </p>
     <p>
      Auditing in the Atherton Tablelands region followed a number of complaints from seasonal fruit and vegetable pickers and packers, including young backpackers.

      <strong>
       Caboolture
      </strong>
      last year found that more than 100 seasonal workers had been short-changed about $32,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last month, Fair Work inspectors visited strawberry farms in Victoria's
      <strong>
       Yarra Valley
      </strong>
      to ensure pickers and other seasonal workers are receiving their full entitlements.
