      The Fair Work Ombudsman is calling on workers who suspect they were underpaid in previous jobs to
      <a href="/how-we-will-help/helping-the-community/search-for-unpaid-wages">
       check
      </a>
      if they are entitled to a share in unclaimed wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agency is currently holding over $2.5 million in trust for around 10,000 people who were underpaid in a former job but cannot be located.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said compliance and enforcement activities regularly find underpayments of both current and former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “If an employee is owed money but has left the business and can’t be located, these entitlements are held in trust until we are able to find them,” Ms Parker says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We make extensive efforts to locate underpaid former employees, using internal investigation records, government public resources, social media and online tools.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 2010, the Fair Work Ombudsman has reunited almost $2 million in unclaimed wages with over 1,800 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In one matter, our efforts to track down a former security guard led to over $21,000 in unpaid wages and entitlements paid to the worker’s family, after it was discovered the former employee had sadly passed away.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, we located a former employee via the electoral roll to pass on over $200 in unpaid wages, while more than $6,000 was returned to a former trolley collector tracked down by the regulator.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Many workers leave their jobs without even knowing that they were underpaid so all workers should check whether they are entitled to unclaimed wages,” Ms Parker says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “With an average entitlement around $250, anyone who thinks they may have been short-changed in a former job should visit the
      <a href="/how-we-will-help/helping-the-community/search-for-unpaid-wages">
       FWO website
      </a>
      to make a claim.”
