      <strong>
       21 April 2016

     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to pass on annual wage increases has left a
      <strong>
       Dandenong
      </strong>
      manufacturing company with an unpaid wages bill of $25,800.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 25 casual employees, who worked various day, afternoon and night shifts, were paid below what they were entitled to under the
      <em>
       Manufacturing and Associated Industries and Occupations Award
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were underpaid their minimum rate, shift loadings and first aid allowance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest underpayment for an individual worker was $3700.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer told Fair Work Inspectors the business believed it had been paying the correct amount and attributed the underpayment to not receiving notification of revised rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers should undertake their own checks of Award provisions and periodically self-audit their compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “In our experience, a common cause of underpayment of wages is the failure by employers to pass on annual wage increases,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our Online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Modern Award, as well as classification and pay rates, including base pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and assisting them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayment was discovered during pro-active auditing of businesses in the Dandenong region.
     </p>
     <p>
      In separate matters, the Fair Work Ombudsman has also recently recouped:
