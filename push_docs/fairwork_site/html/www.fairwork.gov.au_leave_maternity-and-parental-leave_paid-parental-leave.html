      Eligible employees can get parental leave pay from either or both:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the Australian Government under the Paid Parental Leave scheme
      </li>
      <li>
       their employer.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employer-funded paid parental leave doesn't affect an employee's eligibility for the Australian Government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. Employees can get both.
     </p>
     <p>
      These employees are also still entitled to unpaid parental leave.

      In addition to their usual record-keeping requirements, employers whose employees are receiving Parental Leave Pay under the Paid Parental Leave scheme have to keep the following records:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the amount of Parental Leave Pay funding received from the Australian Government for each employee and the period it covers
      </li>
      <li>
       the date each parental leave payment was made to the employee
      </li>
      <li>
       the period each payment covers
      </li>
      <li>
       the gross amount of the payment
      </li>
      <li>
       the net amount paid and the amount of income tax withheld (including other payments, if any were made)
      </li>
      <li>
       a statement identifying the payment as Parental Leave Pay under the Paid Parental Leave scheme
      </li>
      <li>
       the amount of any deductions made from each payment.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Pay slips for Parental Leave Pay
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees who get Parental Leave Pay have to get a pay slip for each payment. The pay slip has to specify that the payments are for Parental Leave Pay under the Paid Parental Leave scheme. For more information, see our

      Employer-funded paid parental leave
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employers can provide paid parental leave in enterprise or other registered agreements, employment contracts, or workplace policies. The amount of leave, pay entitlements and rules about receiving paid parental leave will depend on the relevant agreement, contract or policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employer-funded paid parental leave doesn't affect an employee's eligibility for the Australian Government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. Employees can get both.
