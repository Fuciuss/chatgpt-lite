      <strong>
       12 July 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of a
      <strong>
       Queensland
      </strong>
      restaurant have been penalised a total of $21,000 after paying a young Chinese backpacker just $10 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court imposed the penalties following an investigation and legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker, aged in her 20s and who speaks limited English, was in Australia on a 417 working holiday visa when she took a job at the Fire and Stone Restaurant at the Tangalooma Island Resort on
      <strong>
       Moreton Island
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      She was underpaid $1577 in just 19 days in 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated after the employee lodged a request for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      She should have been classified as a casual employee and paid minimum rates under the
      <em>
       Hospitality Industry (General) Award
      </em>
      ,
      <em>
      </em>
      including more than $21 an hour for ordinary hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      The restaurant operators also contravened record-keeping and pay-slip laws and failed to comply with a Notice to Produce employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business initially refused to back-pay the worker, telling inspectors she “ate too much food and used too much air-conditioning.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court found the restaurant misclassified the worker as an independent contractor and breached sham contracting laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      It penalised owner/operator Jia Ning Wang $3500.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wang’s company - Golden Vision Food and Beverage Services Pty Ltd – was also penalised a further $17,500.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman had previously put Wang on notice to comply with workplace laws after receiving complaints from other workers about being underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Michael Jarrett found that Wang had not displayed any genuine contrition or remorse and said the penalties should send a message to the hospitality industry and employers of visa holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties should “serve as a warning to others that similar conduct can have serious consequences and ought not be repeated,” Judge Jarrett said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that deliberate exploitation of vulnerable workers in Australia will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We treat alleged underpayment of visa-holders particularly seriously,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has another matter before the Court involving Wang and his company, alleging that an international student was underpaid almost $2000 and was fired by text message after she asked to be paid correctly.
