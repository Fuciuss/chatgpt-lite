      <strong>
       30 September 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of a café and delicatessen in South-West
      <strong>
       Western Australia
      </strong>
      have allegedly underpaid their employees more than $20,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      They are facing legal action initiated by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency announced today it had commenced proceedings against
      <strong>
       Gelorup
      </strong>
      couple Mark and Gemma Gumley, who operate the Dalycious Delicatessen at
      <strong>
       Dalyellup
      </strong>
      and the Hidden Gem café at
      <strong>
       Bunbury
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court is Mr Gumley’s company Koojedda Carpentry Pty Ltd, as trustee for the Gumley Trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eight employees at the two cafes were allegedly underpaid a total of $20,036 between June, 2013 and September, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that three staff were each underpaid more than $4000, including a chef from India who was in Australia on a 475 skilled regional sponsored work visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were allegedly underpaid minimum hourly rates and annual leave entitlements, as well as penalty rates for weekend, public holiday and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to documents lodged with the Court, several employees were not paid at all for some work performed and one was not paid wages in lieu of notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated after employees contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Notice served on the employer to produce records was allegedly not complied with and pay slip and frequency-of-pay obligations were also allegedly contravened.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr and Mrs Gumley each face maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention, while Koojedda Carpentry faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for the company to rectify the alleged underpayments, which remain outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      A four-day liability hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      from December 12, 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says efforts were made to resolve the matter by agreement without the need for legal action, but the Agency could not get sufficient co-operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Gumleys had previously been put “on notice” of the need to comply with workplace laws after complaints had been received from other staff about allegedly underpaid wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The previous matters resulted in employees being back-paid more than $4000.
