     <p>
      The Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act) promotes integrity and accountability by providing a legislative scheme for the investigation of allegations of serious wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector. The PID Act facilitates making disclosures, ensures that disclosures are properly investigated, and ensures that public officials who make disclosures in accordance with the PID Act are supported and protected from adverse actions as a result of making a disclosure or assisting with an investigation or review.

     <p>
      Disclosable conduct includes, for example, conduct by an agency, a public official or a contracted service provider that contravenes a law, is corrupt or constitutes maladministration, results in wastage of public money or property, or is an abuse of public trust.

      What isn’t disclosable conduct
     </h2>
     <p>
      Some things are not disclosable conduct. For example, disclosable conduct doesn’t include:
     </p>

      <li>

      We will take active steps to support and to protect individuals who make disclosures under the PID Act.

Those who assist with PID investigations and reviews receive the same protections.
