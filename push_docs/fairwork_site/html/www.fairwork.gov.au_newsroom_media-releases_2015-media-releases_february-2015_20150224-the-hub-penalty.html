      <strong>
       24 February 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of a Gold Coast restaurant have been fined a total of $84,500 after engaging in a campaign of “obfuscation” aimed at avoiding having to back-pay nine employees who had been short-changed almost $17,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman put the matter before the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane after the restaurant failed to co-operate with its efforts to resolve the matter by agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Michael Jarrett has now found that the restaurant deliberately tried to avoid its obligations to its underpaid staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Hub@Varsity - a tapas bar and restaurant at Varsity Lakes
      <strong>
       -
      </strong>
      underpaid the workers a total of $16,881 in wages and entitlements between December, 2011 and December, 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      The venue’s manager and part-owner, Graham John Bell, has been fined $14,500 and his family company, The Hub@Mermaid Pty Ltd, a further $70,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has also ordered the company to undertake a self-audit of its 2013-14 financial year pay practices at the restaurant and to report back on its findings to the Fair Work Ombudsman within three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpaid employees worked as kitchen hands, cooks and waiters and included one worker aged 19-20 who was short-changed $6027.
     </p>
     <p>
      After receiving complaints from employees in 2012, Fair Work inspectors contacted Bell to try to resolve the matter, but Judge Jarrett found that he was “entirely uncooperative”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A series of appointments were made and were either rescheduled or simply not kept,” Judge Jarrett says in his penalty decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman issued Notices to Produce employment documents and ultimately a Compliance Notice in 2013 requiring back-payment of nine employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett found that Bell and his company chose to ignore them and behave in a “highly evasive” manner, which obstructed the investigation and made it difficult for inspectors to determine amounts owed to employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      He found that Bell, on behalf of the restaurant, had taken “deliberate action” to avoid responsibilities to employees and engaged in “nothing more than obfuscation and avoidance”.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett said the underpayments were a serious failure to pay the most basic Award provisions and were “especially egregious” for the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “These are young, relatively unskilled workers earning low rates of pay,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Two of the employees were not paid at all and of the remaining seven, six were not paid between 70 and 85 per cent of their entitlement.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments were finally rectified in June last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett said there was a need to send a warning to other employers and to ensure compliance with minimum standards to “ensure that there is a level playing field for employers in relation to wage costs”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The nature of the breaches and the flagrant disregard of the (Fair Work Ombudsman’s) attempts to investigate and resolve this matter call for a high penalty,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett said the failure to issue pay slips to staff was also a serious breach because it disempowered employees by making it more difficult for them to check they had been paid correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says underpaying employees’ basic entitlements and then refusing to co-operate with inspectors is a recipe for enforcement action by the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We made extensive efforts to resolve this matter outside the Courts, but were left with no option to commence legal action because of the complete lack of co-operation we encountered,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our first preference is always to work with employers to assist them to rectify their non-compliance co-operatively, but we will not tolerate employers not taking our correspondence and demands seriously.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must comply with requests from Fair Work inspectors to provide records relating to employees and former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers must also comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a Court application for a review of the Compliance Notice if they are seeking to challenge it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace laws also stipulate that employers must provide employees with a pay slip within one working day of pay day.
     </p>
