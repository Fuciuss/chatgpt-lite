      Who do the NES apply to?
     </h2>
     <p>
      The NES apply to all employees covered by the national workplace relations system, however only certain entitlements apply to casual employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      These are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       maximum weekly hours
      </li>
      <li>
       2 days of unpaid carer’s leave and 2 days of unpaid compassionate leave per occasion
      </li>
      <li>
       10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave (in a 12-month period)
      </li>
      <li>
       community service leave (except paid jury service)
      </li>
      <li>
       public holidays
      </li>
      <li>
       the Fair Work Information Statement and the Casual Employment Information Statement
      </li>
      <li>
       right to casual conversion.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Casual employees have the right to become a permanent (full-time or part-time) employee in some circumstances. This is known as ‘casual conversion’. This can be a requirement for the employer to offer their employee casual conversion, or a right for the employee to request it.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, casual employees who have been employed for at least 12 months by an employer on a regular and systematic basis and with an expectation of ongoing employment are entitled to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       make requests for flexible working arrangements
      </li>
      <li>
       parental leave and related entitlements.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      There are also 2 NES entitlements that apply to all full-time and part-time employees, whether they are covered by the national workplace relations system or not. These are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       parental leave and related entitlements
      </li>
      <li>
       notice of termination.
      </li>
     </ul>

      </a>
      How do the NES apply?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Terms in awards, registered agreements and employment contracts cannot exclude or provide for an entitlement less than the NES, and those that do have no effect. However, they can affect the operation of the NES in certain ways.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, they may specify terms that deal with:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       averaging an employee’s ordinary hours of work
      </li>
      <li>
       the cashing out and taking of paid annual leave
      </li>
      <li>
       the cashing out of paid sick and carer’s leave
      </li>
      <li>
       extra sick and carer’s leave or annual leave in exchange for foregoing an equivalent amount of pay
      </li>
      <li>
       the substitution of public holidays
      </li>
      <li>
       situations in which redundancy entitlements do not apply.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      They may also supplement the NES by providing entitlements that are more favourable for employees.
