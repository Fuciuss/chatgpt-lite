      Award and agreement free employees

      Most employees are covered by an award or an agreement, but a few jobs and industries aren't.

      Employees that aren't covered by an award or an agreement are entitled to the National Minimum Wage. The National Minimum Wage for a full-time adult employee is $882.80 per week or $23.23 per hour.
     </p>

      Junior employees not covered by an award get a percentage of the National Minimum Wage. For a table of these rates, visit
