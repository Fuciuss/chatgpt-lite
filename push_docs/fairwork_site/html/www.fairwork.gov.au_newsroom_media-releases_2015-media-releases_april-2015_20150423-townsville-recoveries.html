      Eight staff at a
      <strong>
       Townsville
      </strong>
      fast-food café have shared in $7600 back-pay after the Fair Work Ombudsman found the business was inadvertently short-changing the workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were underpaid their minimum hourly rates, weekend and overtime penalty rates last financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The café owners have voluntarily reimbursed all outstanding entitlements after co-operating with Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, the Fair Work Ombudsman has also recouped $7600 for a Townsville accountant not paid her outstanding wages and annual leave entitlements on termination of employment last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says both cases highlight the importance of Townsville employers taking the time to understand their obligations to their employees under federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A small mistake left over time can easily result in a hefty bill for back-payment of wages – so it is important employers get it right in the first place,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell urged local businesses to access the range of free tools available at www.fairwork.gov.au to help them understand and comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include calculators to assist employers and employees determine the correct award and minimum wages for their industry, templates for time-and-wages records and an Online Learning Centre with free interactive courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is supporting compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
