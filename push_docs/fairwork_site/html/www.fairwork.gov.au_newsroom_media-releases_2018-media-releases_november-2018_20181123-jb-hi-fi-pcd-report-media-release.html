      <strong>
       23 November 2018
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has published a report on its compliance partnership with Australian home entertainment and consumer electrical retailer, JB Hi-Fi Group Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      JB Hi-Fi signed a proactive compliance deed with the FWO in 2014 that committed it to a range of measures to promote workplace compliance across its business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The partnership followed a FWO investigation the previous year that identified time-keeping problems had led to underpayments at a JB Hi-Fi store.
     </p>
     <p>
      JB Hi-Fi conducted a self-audit involving a total of 337 employees from 22 stores across its network in the first year of the partnership.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company identified and rectified underpayments totalling $1,397 for 15 workers, with individual underpayments ranging from $2.36 to $367.90.
     </p>
     <p>
      JB Hi-Fi reported that the underpayments arose due to time-keeping errors and found no underpayments of hourly rates, penalty rates or loadings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The partnership led to JB Hi-Fi enhancing its workplace training of managers and staff, and implementing a new online time and attendance system.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also appointed employee liaison officers, so that workers could raise issues directly with head office.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the compliance partnership, the FWO did not receive any requests for assistance from JB Hi-Fi employees involving workplace disputes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said the partnership demonstrates the importance of businesses having robust systems in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The measures JB Hi-Fi implemented under the partnership benefit all of its employees and reduce the risk of future workplace breaches occurring in its network,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Workplace compliance should be a top priority for all businesses, and we have a range of resources available to help employers comply with their obligations.”
