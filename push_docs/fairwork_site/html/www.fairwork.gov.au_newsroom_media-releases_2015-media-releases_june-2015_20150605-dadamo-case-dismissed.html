      <strong>
       5 June 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has dismissed the Fair Work Ombudsman’s legal action against a Perth electrical business.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2010, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action D’Adamo Nominees, which trades as the Wangara-based business L&amp;A Electrics.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was alleged that L&amp;A Electrics underpaid an 18-year-old employee $9892.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court found that the employee was not an apprentice, because his apprenticeship agreement was not signed by a parent or guardian as required under the
      <em>
       Industrial Training Act 1975
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court also dismissed the Fair Work Ombudsman’s submission that the
      <em>
       Electrical Contracting Industry Award 1978
      </em>
      applied to the employee on the basis of a factual finding that the employee did not fit within the classification of “electrical assistant” under the Award.
