      A new national minimum wage comes into effect from the first pay period on or after tomorrow, 1 July 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      From this date, the national minimum wage will increase to $18.29 per hour or $694.90 per week. The base rates of pay in modern awards will also increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      This follows the Fair Work Commission’s announcement of a 3.3 per cent increase to the minimum wage earlier this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is the agency responsible for ensuring that workplace participants were aware of their obligations and for providing information and assistance to employers when their obligations change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said employers should check the new wage rates that apply to their businesses to ensure that they are compliant with their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agency’s online materials, including its Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT), have been updated and can assist employers and workers to calculate the new wage rates. Use our

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important that employers act immediately to pass on the new wage rates to their employees from the first pay period after 1 July and ensure that their workers are receiving their lawful entitlements,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “My agency is here to assist employers to remain up to date and compliant with their workplace obligations. We offer a range of easy-to-use tools on our website to help.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers can also register for a free My Account with the Fair Work Ombudsman, which is an easy way to remain informed and received tailored information relevant to your business.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s online materials have also been updated to reflect changes to penalty rates affecting the Hospitality, Pharmacy, Fast Food, Retail and Restaurant industries, as determined by the Fair Work Commission. These also come into effect from 1 July, 2017.
