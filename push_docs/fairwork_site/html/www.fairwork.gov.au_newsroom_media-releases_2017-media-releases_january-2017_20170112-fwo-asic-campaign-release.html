      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recovered almost $40,000 for underpaid
      <strong>
       Brisbane
      </strong>
      workers as part of a joint campaign with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign involved Fair Work Inspectors and ASIC analysts visiting 46 businesses in Brisbane’s CBD, Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane and West End in May last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors found 32 of the 46 businesses (70 per cent) were fully compliant with their obligations under the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the 14 businesses (30 per cent) with contraventions, six (13 per cent) were found to have underpaid 30 employees a total of $39,526, while the other non-compliant businesses had made errors relating to record-keeping and/or pay slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      The biggest underpayment occurred at a café that short-changed 12 employees a total of $20,600 as a result of underpaying their minimum hourly rates and penalty rates over a 12-month period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors issued the business with two infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) totalling $1800 and a Compliance Notice requiring prompt back-payment of employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors also issued $180 infringement notices to two other businesses with significant record-keeping and pay slip contraventions and issued formal cautions to two other businesses, including one to a restaurant that had underpaid nine employees a total of $4170.
     </p>
     <p>
      All businesses with underpayment issues agreed to promptly back-pay employees in-full after being educated by Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      ASIC Analysts reported finding no significant deficiencies in financial records of any businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was the first time the Fair Work Ombudsman and ASIC have conducted a joint campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The joint campaign was conducted in order to minimise the time impact on small businesses, which would otherwise face separate visits from the two Agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many businesses were randomly selected for visits but there was a focus on businesses with first-time company directors, to ensure they understood their lawful obligations from an early stage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Educating businesses was a key focus of the campaign, with Fair Work Inspectors providing businesses with advice about minimum pay rates and their record-keeping and pay slip obligations and ASIC analysts speaking to new directors about their obligations as company office holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both agencies received positive feedback from businesses and will look for opportunities to conduct further joint activities in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says new businesses should take steps to ensure they develop good compliance habits from an early stage.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We strive to make accessing information and resources as easy as possible to help employers get the basics right as efficiently as possible and build a culture of compliance,” Ms James said.
     </p>

      Resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au include templates for pay slips and time-and-wages sheets and tools for calculating the minimum pay rates that apply to employees. Employers and workers can also call the Fair Work Infoline on
