      <strong>
       14 April 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is warning fruit and vegetable growers in and around
      <strong>
       Stanthorpe
      </strong>
      , in Queensland, to be wary of contractors offering cheap labour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors are currently reviewing allegations that some labour-hire contractors in regional Queensland are underpaying their seasonal workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of those allegedly being short-changed are young backpackers in Australia on 417 working holiday visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says growers using contractors to source their seasonal labour requirements need to be aware of risks associated with low-cost operators.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Contracting out labour for a very low price may result in employees missing out on basic rights like minimum wages, penalties, loadings, overtime, allowances and leave,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will deliver a free presentation to assist Stanthorpe growers to understand their obligations under federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The presentation will form part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s three-year Harvest Trail project.
     </p>
     <p>
      It will be held at 6pm on Wednesday, April 22, at the Applethorpe Research Facility, on New England Highway. Growers do not need to register in advance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says alarm bells should be ringing if contractors offer to provide labour for less than $21.08 an hour, which is the minimum casual rate under the Horticulture Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      He says that under the Fair Work Act, growers can be held liable if they knowingly enter into arrangements with unscrupulous contractors that lead to pickers and packers being short-changed their minimum lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman recommends that growers have a written contract with labour-hire contractors they use, outlining what is expected of the contractor, in particular that they will employ staff in line with Australian workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      In March, the Fair Work Ombudsman delivered a similar presentation to about 30 growers in the
      <strong>
       Lockyer Valley
      </strong>
      , many of whom use contractors to source pickers and packers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says that choosing the contractor who offers the lowest price without looking more closely and asking questions about how they can offer such low prices can damage a business’ reputation and the reputation of a whole growing region.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s also not fair that growers and labour-hire providers doing the right thing are placed at a competitive disadvantage by the behaviour of unscrupulous operators,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a free check-list to help growers ask the right questions of third party contractors available at

     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s Overseas Workers’ Team will this week meet with key stakeholders in the
      <strong>
       Sunshine Coast
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Wide Bay
      </strong>
      regions as part of a separate year-long inquiry into allegations that some 417 backpackers are being exploited.
