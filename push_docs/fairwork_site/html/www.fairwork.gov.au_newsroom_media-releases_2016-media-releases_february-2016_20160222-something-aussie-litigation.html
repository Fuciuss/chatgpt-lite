       The operators of a retail outlet in Melbourne are facing Court for allegedly short-changing three employees, including two overseas workers, a total of more than $90,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Something Aussie Pty Ltd and company director and part-owner Kuan Kok Kan.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Three female shop assistants at the company’s retail outlet on Victoria Street,
       <strong>
        North Melbourne
       </strong>
       , were allegedly paid flat rates as low as $16 and $17 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employer allegedly contravened his obligations under the
       <em>
        General Retail Industry Award
       </em>
       , including minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, annual leave entitlements and weekend and public holiday penalty rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Award obligations to minimum engagement periods and provision of meal breaks were also allegedly breached.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Two of the employees were visa-holders from Thailand when they commenced work with Something Aussie and spoke little English.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Each of the three employees was allegedly underpaid just over $30,000 over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015, resulting in a collective underpayment of $91,238.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence litigation because of the seriousness of the alleged contraventions and because Mr Kan had previously been educated about his workplace obligations in 2012.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Kan faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Something Aussie Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking an injunction restraining Mr Kan and Something Aussie from contravening workplace laws in future.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A directions hearing is listed for March 16 in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne.
      </span>
