      A number of workers throughout regional Victoria have been back-paid almost $50,000 in wages and entitlements following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The biggest recovery was $20,000 for an
      <strong>
       Echuca
      </strong>
      café manager, aged in her 20s, who lodged a complaint after not being paid for extra hours worked over a 12-month period in 2012-2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayment occurred because the employee was paid a salary which did not include payment for the extra hours she was required to work to perform duties such as rostering, ordering stock and opening and closing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees should generally be paid for work performed outside their normal hours, such as meetings, training and tasks such as balancing cash registers and opening and closing the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important regional Victorian employers are aware of the workplace laws that apply to their business, otherwise they can end up facing back-payment bills they weren’t budgeting for,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said the employees were reimbursed without the need for further enforcement action after Fair Work inspectors contacted the employers and explained their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We’re confident the underpayments were inadvertent and it’s pleasing that employers accepted assistance from inspectors to put processes in place to ensure errors aren’t repeated,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $10,900 for an apprentice tradesman at
       <strong>

      </li>
      <li>
       $6500 for a
       <strong>
        Warrnambool
       </strong>
       truck driver not paid his annual leave and long service leave entitlements upon termination of employment in 2012,
      </li>
      <li>
       $5500 for a
       <strong>
        Warracknabeal
       </strong>

      </li>
      <li>
       $5000 for a
       <strong>
        Mildura
       </strong>

      </li>
     </ul>
