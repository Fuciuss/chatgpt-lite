      A Canberra carpentry business is facing court for allegedly ignoring a Fair Work Commission order to compensate an employee who had been unfairly dismissed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Canberra man Heath Wright and his company HW Carpentry Solutions Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      In August, the Fair Work Commission ordered the company to pay $7650 compensation to an adult apprentice tradesman it found had been unfairly dismissed last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee lodged a complaint with the Fair Work Ombudsman after the compensation was not paid within the required 14 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman made several requests for the company to comply with the Commission’s orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made repeated efforts to engage with this business to try to resolve the matter, but were not able to secure co-operation,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says her Agency has an important role to play in enforcing orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Compliance is fundamental for the integrity of the workplace relations system and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Wright faces a maximum penalty of $10,200 and his company faces a maximum penalty of $51,000. The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for the company to pay the outstanding compensation to the employee. A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Canberra on February 2.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is one of a number of Fair Work Ombudsman litigations alleging breach of a Fair Work Commission order to pay unfair dismissal compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the one case that has been finalised in Court, Melbourne company World Gym Sunshine Pty Ltd and its director Wayne George Mailing were fined almost $50,000 in September, 2014 for ignoring an order to pay $2200 compensation to a young employee (see
