      A review of the FWO's activities from 2006-2012
     </h2>
     <p>
      In July 2014 the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Employment and Labour Relations Law released their report ‘The Transformation of Enforcement of Minimum Employment Standards in Australia: A Review of the FWO’s activities from 2006 – 2012’.
     </p>
     <p>
      The report covers the changes to our role of monitoring and enforcing compliance with Australian workplace relations laws. It analyses how we have responded to funding constraints by becoming more strategic and sophisticated in our enforcement activities.

      </li>
      <li>
       identifying inconsistencies between awards and the National Employment Standards.
      </li>
     </ul>
