       A
       <strong>
        Sydney
       </strong>
       businessman is to face court over allegations he paid some workers at his former child-care centre less than $4 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges one employee was paid just $2.15 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Others were allegedly paid as little as $3.31, $3.37 and $3.98 an hour whilst working at the former Bollygum Childcare Centre in western Sydney.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The business went into liquidation last year, preventing legal action against the company.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, the Fair Work Ombudsman has initiated legal proceedings against the former owner-operator, Mark Edward Myles, in the Federal Circuit Court.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A Statement of Claim filed with the Court alleges Mr Myles was involved in underpaying 16 child-care workers almost $362,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       One employee in her early 20s was allegedly underpaid $49,533 over four years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Seven of the former staff were under 21 at the time of the alleged underpayments – over five years from 2008 to 2013 – and some were trainees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Bollygum Childcare Centre was based at
       <strong>
        South Penrith
       </strong>
       and then
       <strong>
        Lethbridge Park
       </strong>
       during that time.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman says the alleged underpayments are primarily the result of the employees being paid flat hourly rates of pay.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The flat rate allegedly did not cover minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, overtime rates, annual leave entitlements or a laundry allowance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, the Fair Work Ombudsman has acknowledged that pay rates varied significantly between employees - with some being paid substantially above their lawful minimum entitlements for some work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors discovered the alleged breaches when they investigated complaints from employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Myles was also allegedly involved in contravening the adverse action provisions of the Fair Work Act.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He allegedly reduced the rostered work of one employee, aged in her early 20s, in response to her complaint to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Breaches of record-keeping and pay slip laws are also alleged.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the litigation is a response to a number of factors surrounding the case.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       These include the large amount allegedly owing, the involvement of young, vulnerable young workers and the seriousness of the alleged adverse action conduct.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says it will be alleged in Court that Mr Myles was well informed of his obligations as an employer, but failed to ensure his business was compliant.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Myles faces maximum penalties of between $3300 and $10,200 per breach.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order for any penalty to be paid to the employees to partially rectify the alleged underpayments.
