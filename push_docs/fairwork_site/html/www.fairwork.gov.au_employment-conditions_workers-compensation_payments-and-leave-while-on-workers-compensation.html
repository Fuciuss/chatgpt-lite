      Payment of workers compensation
     </h2>
     <p>
      The amount of money paid to employees on workers compensation will depend on the state or territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount paid to an employee is an insurance payment and not a wage. The employee is paid:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       directly by the insurer
      </li>
      <li>
       from the insurer through the employer, or
      </li>
      <li>
       by the workers compensation regulator.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      What if my employer does not pay the workers compensation?
     </h3>
     <p>
      Sometimes the insurer accepts the workers compensation claim and the employer doesn't pass on the insurance money to the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee can take the following steps to resolve this issue:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Contact the employer regarding the payment.
      </li>
      <li>
       Contact the insurance company regarding the matter.
      </li>
