     <p>
      Employees are entitled to a minimum wage based on their award and their classification in the award.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees can receive a penalty rate, or higher rate of pay, for working at different times or on different days, like weekends or public holidays.

      Salary payments and flat rates
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employees can be paid a ‘flat rate’, as long as they are paid at least the minimum amount they would have received under their award for the hours they work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Restaurant Award has specific rules about entering into annual wage arrangements. These arrangements allow employers to pay their employees an annualised wage to cover some of their award minimum entitlements. This arrangement is different to paying an annual salary under an employment contract.

      Employers can ask someone to do a trial shift while they see whether the person is suitable for the job.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some trial shifts can be unpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, trial shifts should be paid if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       it isn’t needed for the person to show their skills
      </li>
      <li>
       the shift has gone on for longer than is needed for the person to show their skills
      </li>
      <li>
       the shift involves more than just checking out the person’s relevant skills
      </li>
      <li>
       the person isn’t under direct supervision for the trial.
      </li>
