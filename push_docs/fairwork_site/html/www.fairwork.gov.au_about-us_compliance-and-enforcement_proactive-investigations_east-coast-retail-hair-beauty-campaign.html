      Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      We consider that both industries in these areas would benefit from a compliance and education campaign for several reasons, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       low compliance rates identified in our National Hair and Beauty Campaign 2012-2013
      </li>
      <li>
       the fact that both industries are significant employers, particularly of young workers
      </li>
      <li>
       the need to address issues that have been noted in both industries, such as unpaid work trials.
      </li>
     </ul>

     <p>
      During this campaign, Fair Work Inspectors are engaging with up to 1600 businesses from these industries across the three states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors are contacting employers and requesting a sample of employee time and wages records for assessment against the Fair Work Act and Fair Work Regulations 2009, and the applicable award or agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors are checking that employers are meeting their obligations, including in relation to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       minimum wages
      </li>
      <li>
       penalty rates and overtime
      </li>
      <li>
       overtime rates
      </li>
      <li>
       pay slips and record-keeping.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Once the campaign is completed, a report detailing the findings of the campaign will be published on the
