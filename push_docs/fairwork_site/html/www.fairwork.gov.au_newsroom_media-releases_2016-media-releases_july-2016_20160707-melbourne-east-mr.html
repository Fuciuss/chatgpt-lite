      <strong>
       7 July 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A real estate agent in the Melbourne suburb of
      <strong>
       Hawthorn
      </strong>
      has received extensive advice and assistance about its workplace obligations after paying a visa-holder just $9 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business has also agreed to back-pay the 28-year-old Chinese worker $5000 after the Fair Work Ombudsman found he was being underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee, who was on a 485 temporary graduate visa, was paid less than $375 a week for duties including drafting contracts, general administration and assisting buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      He sought assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman after reading about Australia's minimum wage and trying unsuccessfully to resolve the issue with his employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      When contacted by the Fair Work Ombudsman, the business operator believed that the employee was being correctly paid as an intern.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman explained that the worker was an employee, and even if on probation, was entitled to the minimum wage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information on internships is available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s
      <a href="/pay/unpaid-work/work-experience-and-internships">
       Work experience and internships page
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers need to take the time to understand the wage rates applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is unacceptable for an employer to take advantage of any worker, especially overseas workers who have a limited understanding of their workplace rights," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have minimum pay rates in Australia, they apply to everyone, and they are not negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      "While many employers want to do the right thing, there are some who seek to gain a competitive advantage by exploiting vulnerable workers, such as visa-holders."
     </p>
     <p>
      In separate matters, in Melbourne’s east, the Fair Work Ombudsman has also recovered:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $20,400 for a storeman in
       <strong>
        Mount Waverley
       </strong>
       who was paid $19 an hour for three-and-a-half years when he should have received up to $23.08,
      </li>
      <li>
       $8900 for a salesman who worked across Melbourne's eastern suburbs and was not paid for weekend work, annual leave and travel time during overseas business trips,
      </li>
      <li>
       $8000 for a young male labourer in
       <strong>
        Bayswater North
       </strong>
       who should have received a casual hourly rate but was paid part-time wages without the entitlements of a permanent employee,
      </li>
      <li>
       $8000 for a full-time young male general labourer whose
       <strong>
        Donvale
       </strong>
       employer paid him first-year apprentice rates but had never signed an apprenticeship contract, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $7500 for a male welder in
       <strong>
        Bayswater North
       </strong>
       who did not receive his annual leave upon resignation.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is important that businesses, particularly small businesses, know that they can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for advice and assistance if they are unsure of their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees and employers can also use the Fair Work Ombudsman's free online tools and resources to check entitlements specific to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency's Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements. Visit

      </a>
      to learn more.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said most underpayments were inadvertent and the result of employers failing to check their minimum obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      "When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2014-15, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered $702,886 in underpaid wages and entitlements for 203 employees in Melbourne's eastern suburbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      She encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      for advice. A free interpreter service is available on
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Infoline also offers a priority service to small business callers whose leading concerns after about wages, conditions, termination of employment, leave and entitlements.
