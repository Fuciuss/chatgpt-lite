       making clothing, bags or footwear
      </li>
      <li>
       cutting, sewing, or finishing work, such as embroidery or sewing tags onto apparel

      The Textile and Clothing Award is a legal document that sets out wages and other conditions for outworkers. It applies even when there’s a registered agreement in place that covers the outworker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schedule F of the Textile and Clothing Award provides the minimum pay and conditions for outworkers. Outworkers need to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       be engaged on a full-time or regular part-time basis
      </li>
      <li>
       receive at least the minimum award pay rate for their appropriate classification, even if they’re a pieceworker
      </li>
      <li>
       get overtime, certain allowances and penalties

     <p>
      Part-time employees are entitled to work at least 15 hours per week. This can be reduced to 10 hours per week with the agreement of the relevant union in the employee’s state or territory.

     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       hours of work
      </li>
