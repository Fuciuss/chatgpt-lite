      <strong>
       3 August 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Two Korean backpackers working as cleaners in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      were underpaid thousands of dollars in just three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two were in Australia on 417 working holiday visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      In March last year, they took full-time jobs with a contractor to clean at a local college.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were paid flat rates as low as $15 an hour, cash-in-hand, and received their rosters via text message.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Cleaning Services Award
      </em>
      they should have received a minimum of $18.01 an hour - rising to $27.02 on Saturdays, $36.02 on Sundays and $45.03 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two were short-changed a total of $5400 and $4085 each between March and June.
     </p>
     <p>
      They have recently been fully reimbursed after requesting assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both had limited English, and one required the services of an interpreter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The money was repaid after the Fair Work Ombudsman issued the employer with a Compliance Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      A repayment plan of fortnightly instalments over three months was agreed to after the business provided evidence of financial hardship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has been issued with a formal Letter of Caution following its behaviour.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This puts the business on notice that further breaches of workplace laws may result in enforcement action against it," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The business was also issued with an Infringement Notice (on-the-spot fine) for $850 over its failure to issue employees with pay-slips."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that when first approached, the employer indicated he had looked to the Korean business community to work out a "going rate" for cleaners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is increasingly finding cases of employers from non-English speaking backgrounds not understanding their workplace obligations or appreciating the seriousness of failing to comply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says there is no "going rate" for Korean employees or indeed employees of any other nationality.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Minimum wage rates apply to everyone in Australia - including visa-holders - and they are not negotiable," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Anyone operating a business, including migrants, needs to ensure they take the time to understand the workplace laws applicable to their business," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer engaged an accountant, who suggested to Fair Work inspectors that the employees were independent contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      "In the absence of a Tax File Number (TFN), an Australian Business Number (ABN) and a contract, this was dismissed," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors have now educated the accountant about bogus and sham contracting provisions of the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      following his limited understanding of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says the Agency is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is important that there be a fair, competitive environment for employers who are doing the right thing by creating a level playing field in relation to business costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Visa-holders who are offered a job where there is no paperwork to sign and payments are made in cash should be concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a number of Inquiries underway to identify and address the structural and behavioural drivers of non-compliance in various industry networks and supply chains in which overseas workers are heavily represented.
     </p>
     <p>
      These include a review of the wages and conditions of workers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa and a Harvest Trail inquiry into the horticulture and viticulture sectors nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman recently released information about the work it conducted in calendar year 2015 involving visa-holders - view the

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      "Visa-holders can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or are reluctant to seek help, so we place a high priority on taking action to ensure their rights are protected," Ms James said.
