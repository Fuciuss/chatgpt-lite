       February 18 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In an Australian first, two Adelaide businesses will face court after refusing to pay on-the-spot fines for their alleged failure to regularly issue payslips to overseas workers recruited from China and India.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has announced it is taking legal action against both businesses – a Chinese restaurant and a mobile device repair business - after they refused to pay $850 and $550 fines for their alleged workplace contraventions.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Facing legal proceedings in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia are:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        Dragon Tea House Pty Ltd, which operates a Chinese restaurant in Pulteney Street and the business manager and majority owner Xiaoxu Zhou, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        Glenelg-based mobile device repair business Mobizone Pty Ltd and business manager and part-owner Raymond Kebbe.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       Dragon Tea House and Mobizone each face maximum penalties of up to $25,500, while Ms Zhou and Mr Kebbe each face maximum penalties of up to $5100.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman audited the two businesses last year as part of its monitoring activity of employers who recruit staff on 457 skilled worker visas.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Dragon Tea House was allegedly failing to issue payslips to a restaurant manager on a 457 visa and a front-of-house employee on a student visa - both from China.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mobizone allegedly issued payslips infrequently to an Indian telecommunications technician on a 457 visa, and only when he asked for them.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Act requires employers to issue employees with payslips within one working day of paying their wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors issued Dragon Tea House with an $850 Infringement Notice and Mobizone with a $550 Infringement Notice, both to be paid within 28 days.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under workplace law, employers must pay Infringement Notice penalties within the specified period or make a written application for the Notice to be withdrawn.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said inspectors made repeated requests for the two businesses to pay up, but they failed to comply.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is the first time the Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action solely in relation to payslip contraventions after an Infringement Notice was ignored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says Fair Work inspectors identify breaches of workplace laws at thousands of businesses nationally each year and resolve the vast majority by working co-operatively with employers and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they comply in future.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, in cases of repeated or blatant breaches of record-keeping or payslip laws, Infringement Notices are an enforcement option that the Agency will use as a deterrent and to promote a culture of compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says employers should be aware that the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Infringement Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We place a high importance on enforcing compliance with payslip obligations, because when employees don’t receive them, it undermines their ability to understand how their wages have been calculated and to check they’ve received their minimum lawful entitlements,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It is particularly concerning when vulnerable overseas workers are not provided with payslips, because they are often not fully aware of their rights and entitlements under Australian workplace laws.”
