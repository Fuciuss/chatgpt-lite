      <strong>
       2 March 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Underpaying staff and sham contracting has cost two Gold Coast travel businesses almost $138,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane imposed the penalty following litigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman took legal action after finding that two Main Beach-based Global Work &amp; Travel outlets had underpaid six workers more than $25,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Husband-and-wife owner-managers Pierre and Caryl Himmelmann have been fined a total of $22,515.
     </p>
     <p>
      Their majority family-owned companies Global Work &amp; Travel Co. Pty Ltd and Global Work &amp; Travel Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd have also been penalised $60,018 and $56,306 each.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr and Mrs Himmelmann’s son Jurgen, a joint operator of the businesses, has been required to undertake training on employer obligations under workplace laws over his involvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpaid workers, most in their 20s, had been misclassified as independent contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three worked as travel agents, sales consultants and as a program coordinator and recruitment officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman became involved after receiving complaints from the employees about their wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were being paid retainers of between $250 and $750 a week, plus commissions and bonuses on sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      But the Fair Work Ombudsman formed the view they were employees, not independent contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      It says they should have been paid Award entitlements, including minimum wages, leave payments, overtime and penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result, the workers were underpaid a total of $25,250 for various periods of work performed between January, 2011 and October, 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record-keeping laws were also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the underpayments were rectified in 2013, the Fair Work Ombudsman proceeded with legal action because of the seriousness of the matter and the employer’s carelessness towards breaches.
     </p>
     <p>
      The misclassification and underpayment occurred despite the Himmelmanns being advised by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) that one of the workers was an employee for superannuation purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Himmelmanns also failed to take action in response to another worker telling them that the ATO would not issue her with an Australian Business Number because she was an employee, not a contractor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says sham contracting is a serious matter that results in employees being denied basic workplace rights and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      “There are clearly consequences for business operators who recklessly breach their employees’ workplace rights through sham contracting,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “In cases where we suspect sham contracting is occurring, we look behind the often carefully drafted legal documents to determine what the correct classification for workers is under workplace laws.”
