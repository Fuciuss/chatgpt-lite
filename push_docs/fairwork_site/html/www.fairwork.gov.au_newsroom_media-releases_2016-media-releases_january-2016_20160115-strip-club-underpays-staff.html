      <strong>
       15 January 2016

     </p>
     <p>
      Hospitality workers at a
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      strip club have been reimbursed thousands of dollars after an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman found they were being underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 22 employees, who served food and drinks at the adult entertainment venue, were short-changed a total of $12,600 because they were paid flat hourly rates between $23.50 and $23.85.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the club paid above the standard $21.31 required under the
      <em>
       Hospitality Industry Award
      </em>
      , it was not enough to cover applicable penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The mostly casual employees should have been paid up to $25.58 an hour for work on Saturdays, $29.84 on Sundays and $48.65 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business made an incorrect assumption that paying staff an annual salary on a pro-rata basis would be sufficient to cover their penalty rate entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the strip club was randomly audited as part of a recent pro-active hospitality campaign conducted by the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The club has been asked to review its wage records for the past 12 months to ensure no other current or former employees have been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, the Fair Work Ombudsman has discovered that eight overseas workers, including visa-holders, were short-changed almost $13,000 by a cafe in Melbourne's CBD.
     </p>
     <p>
      The shop manager and seven sandwich hands were paid flat rates as little as $16 an hour over a period of 10 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were underpaid their standard hourly rate, overtime, weekend and public holiday penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer also admitted issuing incomplete time-and-wage records and pay-slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fast Food Industry Award
      </em>
      , they were entitled to a standard hourly rate of $19.59 and up to $43.10 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors determined that two workers had been underpaid almost $4000 each, while underpayments for the other six workers ranged from $254 to $1836.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer claimed he had not been aware that minimum hourly rates and penalty rates applied.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries in the Melbourne CBD include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $10,200 for eight retail workers who were underpaid their minimum hourly rate, casual, weekend and public holiday penalty rates, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $10,700 for a 49-year-old female architect who was underpaid a month’s wages.
      </li>
     </ul>
