      Sexual harassment
     </h2>
     <p>
      Everyone has the right to a workplace that is safe and free from sexual harassment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workers, future workers and people conducting a business or undertaking (such as self-employed people or sole traders) are protected from sexual harassment connected to work, including in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sexual harassment is:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an unwelcome sexual advance or request for sexual favours to the person who is harassed
      </li>
      <li>
       other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person who is harassed.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      To be sexual harassment, it has to be reasonable to expect that there is a possibility that the person being harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by the behaviour. This means that whether behaviour is sexual harassment depends on how a reasonable person would interpret the behaviour in that situation. Behaviour that is sexual harassment in one situation may not be in a different situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      When working out whether certain conduct is sexual harassment, the intention of the alleged harasser doesn’t matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sexual harassment doesn’t have to be repeated or continuous. It can be a one-off incident.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sexual harassment in the course of employment can be considered serious misconduct and can be a valid reason for dismissal. Find out more information about:

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A person could also experience sexual harassment by being exposed to or witnessing this kind of behaviour in their work environment or culture. For example, overhearing a conversation or seeing a sexually explicit poster in the workplace.

     <h3>

      Bullying in the workplace

     <p>
      Bullying happens at work when:

     <ul>
      <li>
       a person or group of people repeatedly behave unreasonably towards another worker or a group of worker
      </li>
      <li>
       the behaviour creates a risk to health and safety.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Some forms of sexual harassment can also be considered bullying if the behaviour is repeated or continuous.

      Under the Fair Work Act, a person or company may be liable for sexual harassment committed by an employee or agent in connection with work, including if they were involved in the employer’s contravention.
