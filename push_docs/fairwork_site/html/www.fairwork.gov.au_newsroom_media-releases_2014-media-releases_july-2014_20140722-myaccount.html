      The Fair Work Ombudsman website has attracted more than 650,000 visitors since it was revamped last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      And more than 3000 users have already registered to set up their own personalised accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website allows users to create their own account using MyAccount and save information tailored to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the number of people accessing the free online pay tools, such as PayCheck Plus, continues to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Recently, we had a record 10,000 visits to PayCheck Plus in one day,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      PayCheck Plus allows employers to determine the correct rates of pay that apply to their business and these can then be saved to a private account.
     </p>
     <p>
      With more than 10 million visits a year,
      <a href="/">
       www.fairwork.gov.au
      </a>
      is a popular resource for employers and employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the new website can assist people with basic information, but also provides tools and resources for those who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, the site now features an interactive Online Learning Centre, which has already attracted more than 12,000 users, mostly small business operators.
     </p>
     <p>
      Free online courses for employers include
      <em>
       Difficult conversations in the workplace
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Hiring new employees.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s small business helpline – which launched in December to provide tailored advice to small business people – has now responded to more than 100,000 calls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses can sign up to a regular E-newsletter from the Fair Work Ombudsman with helpful workplace tips and information.
