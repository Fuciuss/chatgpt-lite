      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against Trucking Services Pty Ltd, a road transport business based on the
      <strong>
       Gold Coast
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Trucking Services breached the Fair Work Act by failing to comply with a Compliance Notice requiring it to calculate and back-pay entitlements owed to a truck driver for work he completed between June 2017 and August 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Inspector issued the Compliance Notice in October 2019 in response to a request for assistance from the truck driver.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Compliance Notice was issued after the Fair Work Inspector conducted an investigation and formed a belief that Trucking Services allegedly underpaid minimum wages, overtime rates, weekend and public holiday penalties, carting livestock allowance and annual leave loading under the Road Transport and Distribution Award 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO also alleges in the Compliance Notice that Trucking Services breached the Fair Work Act by failing to pay out accrued annual leave on termination of the driver’s employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker says compliance notices are an important tool to recover unpaid wages, and they will be enforced where they are not followed.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, inspectors can issue a Compliance Notice if they form a belief that an employer has breached certain workplace laws. Where employers do not comply with our notices, a court can order them to pay penalties in addition to back-paying any affected employees,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We encourage any workers with concerns about their pay and entitlements to contact us for assistance.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is seeking penalties against Trucking Services. The company faces a maximum penalty of $31,500.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a Court Order requiring Trucking Services to take the action required by the Compliance Notice, which includes calculating and then rectifying all owed entitlements in full, plus superannuation and interest.
