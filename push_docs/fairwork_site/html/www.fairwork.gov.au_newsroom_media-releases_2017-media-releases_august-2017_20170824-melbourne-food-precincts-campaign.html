       More than 50 restaurants, bars and cafes in some of Melbourne’s most popular entertainment precincts have received surprise visits from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Over the past two days Fair Work inspectors have been conducting on-site audits of businesses in Swanston Street and Lygon Street in
       <strong>
        Carlton
       </strong>
       , Sydney Road in
       <strong>
        Brunswick
       </strong>
       and St Georges Road in
       <strong>
        Fitzroy North
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors have been checking businesses’ time and wage records to ensure that they are complying with their workplace obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors are also talking to employees, managers and business owners about wage and entitlements matters as well as providing advice, assistance and information about how the agency can help.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the areas being targeted have a high density of hospitality businesses, which employ a large number of young and overseas workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Intelligence received by the agency in relation to some businesses operating in these areas suggest a culture of paying flat rates well below the minimum wage and potential record-keeping breaches.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We know that young and migrant workers can be particularly vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace due to a lack of experience and a limited awareness of their workplace rights,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “This vulnerability may be compounded in highly competitive and price-driven markets, such as popular restaurant and bar strips, where some operators might attempt to gain an unfair advantage by cost-cutting through the underpayment of wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “These spot-checks are designed to identify any instances of non-compliance in these precincts.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Building a culture of compliance where employers are fully aware of and abide by their workplace obligations will help create a level playing field for businesses in the interests of both employers and their workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Businesses should be aware that refusal to cooperate with my agency or any examples of serious non-compliance may lead to enforcement action, including litigation,” Ms James said.
      </span>
