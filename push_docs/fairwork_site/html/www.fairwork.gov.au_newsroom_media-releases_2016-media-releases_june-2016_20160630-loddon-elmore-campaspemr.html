      <strong>
       30 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of a recent campaign in Victoria’s
      <strong>
       Loddon-Elmore-Campaspe
      </strong>
      region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spot checks of 251 businesses across the region found:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       173 (69 per cent) were paying their employees correctly,
      </li>
      <li>
       149 (59 per cent) were compliant with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations,
      </li>
      <li>
       113 (45 per cent) were compliant with all their responsibilities.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Sixty three employers were asked to back-pay a total of $80,116 to 183 of their employees who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amounts recovered from individual businesses ranged from $100 to more than $9000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors issued three businesses with Letters of Caution putting them on notice that future breaches of workplace laws could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three employers also received on-the-spot fines of up to $1700 for breaches of their record-keeping or pay-slip obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign targeted businesses across a range of industry sectors, including dairying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers were randomly audited in towns across the region, including

      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses found to be non-complaint will be re-audited as part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s ongoing National Compliance Monitoring Campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the campaign aimed to boost employer awareness of workplace responsibilities and help them access, understand and apply information to build a strong compliance culture.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says that between 2011 and 2014, requests for assistance from employees in the Loddon-Elmore area increased by 60 per cent and from the Campaspe region by 48 per cent.
