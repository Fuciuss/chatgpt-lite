      Under workplace health and safety (WHS) laws, employers have to do what they can to ensure the health and safety of their workers and others at the workplace. Employees also have responsibilities under those laws.

     </p>
     <p>
      This could include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       requesting to work from home (if this is a safe and practical option), or
      </li>
      <li>
       taking some form of leave, such as annual leave or long service leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Normal leave application processes still apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee doesn't come to an arrangement to work from home with their employer, or doesn’t use paid leave, then they aren’t entitled to be paid for choosing not to work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees who stop work because it’s unsafe aren’t taking industrial action. Employees need to comply with directions from their employer to perform other appropriate and safe work, if that direction is reasonable. For more information about employees’ rights to stop work see

       Example: Employee chooses to self-isolate due to health concerns

       Jeff wants to self-isolate as a precaution because he has a weakened immune system. He contacts his employer to discuss his concerns and asks to work from home for the next few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeff's employer is already aware of his condition. They check their working from home policy and conduct a risk assessment to make sure Jeff’s home office will be safe for him to use. They then let Jeff know that they’re happy to let him work from home for the next 2 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeff and his employer agree that after 2 weeks, they'll review the arrangement to make sure it's working and to discuss whether it’s still necessary.
