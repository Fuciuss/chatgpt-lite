      <strong>
       12 July 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      restaurant is facing the Federal Circuit Court for allegedly underpaying a visa-holder from Taiwan as little as $10 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee, who spoke limited English, was allegedly short-changed $33,000 in just nine months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aged in her mid-20s, she came to Australia on a 417 working holiday visa and got a job as a kitchen hand at the Food Republic restaurant, now Kitchen Republik, at
      <strong>
       Box Hill
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee worked at the restaurant from June to November in 2014 and again from March to July last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      She has since returned to Taiwan.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the employee was paid flat hourly rates of $10 and $11.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      she was entitled to have been paid $17.49 to $18.02 for ordinary hours and penalty rates ranging from $22.53 to $45.05 for weekend, public holiday and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment in lieu of notice and annual leave entitlements on termination of the former employee were allegedly not paid and record-keeping and pay-slip contraventions are also alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the employee lodged a request for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency today announced it had commenced legal action against Food Republic Australia Pty Ltd, which operates the restaurant.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the restaurant has back-paid its former employee, Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the size of the alleged underpayment and the involvement of a vulnerable worker were significant factors in a decision to litigate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Food Republic Australia Pty Ltd faces maximum penalties ranging from $25,500 to $51,000 per contravention for multiple alleged breaches of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders requiring the company to commission workplace relations training for its directors and to commission a professional external audit of the company’s pay practice next year and rectify any underpayments discovered.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on August 2.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s three-year National Hospitality Industry Campaign, finalised earlier this year, resulted in more than $1.2 million being recovered for underpaid employees at restaurants, cafés and catering companies throughout Australia.
