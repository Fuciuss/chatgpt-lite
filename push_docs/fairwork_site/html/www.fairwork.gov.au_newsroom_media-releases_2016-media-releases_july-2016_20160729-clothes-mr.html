      <strong>
       29 July 2016

       Dozens of staff at a high-end national clothing company have been back-paid more than $162,100 following an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       What started with one employee seeking assistance for unpaid wages ultimately resulted in back-payments for 36 workers across stores in
       <strong>
        Sydney
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Melbourne
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Brisbane
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Adelaide
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employer was paying its casual adult sales assistants a flat rate of $21 an hour, which was not enough to cover their penalty rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The business had incorrectly assumed that sales commissions would offset the underpayment of the flat rate for any work attracting penalties.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were underpaid a total of $148,100 in wages and $14,000 in superannuation between June, 2013 and June last year.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors spent months investigating the matter, believing on employee’s unsuccessful attempt at resolving issues with the company was not isolated.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The highest amount back-paid to an individual was more than $11,100.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said the company has since reviewed the pay and contracts of all its full-time and casual employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the Agency has been working with the company to ensure its ongoing future compliance with federal workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Employers must ensure they understand the wage rates applicable to their employees, including penalty rates,” she says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated.”
      </span>

       “Our experience and research tells us businesses are over-confident about workplace laws and many do not seek advice or help until something starts to go awry,” Ms James said.
