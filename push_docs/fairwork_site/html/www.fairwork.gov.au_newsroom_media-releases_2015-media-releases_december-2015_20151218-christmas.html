      The Fair Work Ombudsman has urged employers and employees to check the pay rates and entitlements that apply over Christmas and the New Year.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whether you are an employer gearing up for a busy festive trading period, or an employee working through the holidays, it’s important you are aware of your workplace rights and obligations," says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      "While most people are looking forward to a break this festive season, many people will be working, and it’s important they receive the correct wages."
     </p>
     <p>
      Underpayment of penalty rates can happen over holiday periods if employers are unaware of their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Unfortunately, this can result in hefty bills for back-payment of wages down the track – bills that employers were not budgeting for," Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says the Fair Work Ombudsman website www.fairwork.gov.au is the ideal starting point for workers and employers seeking assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says anyone with a work-related query can take advantage of the wide range of tools, resources and videos on the website to assist them in determining their entitlements and obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The website also features a dedicated section for calculating the applicable public holiday pay rates in each State and Territory at
      <a href="/leave/public-holidays/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/publicholidays
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Advice includes how to request or decline work on public holidays, what employers need to pay on public holidays that fall during annual leave, shutting down a workplace over Christmas and New Year and other frequently asked questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says young people taking their first job over the summer holidays should also visit the website to ensure their pay rates are correct.
     </p>
     <p>
      "One of the best defences for young people against being treated unfairly at work is an awareness of their workplace rights," she said.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
