     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has assisted three workers in suburbs west of Melbourne to recover more than $50,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest recovery of $28,224 went to the former employee of a haulage company in
      <strong>
       Laverton North
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The long distance truck driver was underpaid his pay per kilometre rate and travel allowance over a five year period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Just before his employment was terminated the full-time interstate line haul driver was receiving 37 cents per kilometre.
     </p>
     <p>
      But during that period, under the
      <em>
       Road Transport (Long Distance Operations) Award 2010
      </em>
      , he should have received at least 40.88 cents per kilometre plus the appropriate travel allowance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The driver contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman seeking assistance after realising he had been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business agreed to rectify the underpayment after being issued with a contravention letter by Fair Work Inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors also issued the employer with a Letter of Caution, placing it on notice that future breaches may attract enforcement action, including litigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says haulage companies need to remember that pay rates per kilometre are affected by the Annual Wage Review, just as hourly pay rates are.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It may seem like an insignificant underpayment – around two cents an hour plus travel allowance - but mistakes like this can add up over time and leave an employer with a hefty bill for back-payment of entitlements that they were not budgeting for,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also recently assisted with the following recoveries in Melbourne’s western suburbs:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $14,891 for a manager at an industrial equipment business in
       <strong>
        Derrimut
       </strong>
       who was not paid his annual leave entitlements upon termination,
      </li>
      <li>
       $7309 for an apprentice carpenter in
       <strong>
        Caroline Springs
       </strong>
       who was underpaid his base hourly rate of pay over more than 12 months.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      All employees have now been reimbursed their entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the businesses in these matters avoided enforcement action by co-operating and agreeing to take steps to ensure they comply in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Award, as well as classification and pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates,” Ms James says.
