      A
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      manufacturing company and one of its directors will face Court after allegedly paying a Sri Lankan couple as little as $8 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the low wage rate resulted in the couple being short-changed more than $86,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency announced today that it was taking legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against Delahill Pty Ltd, which trades as ABCO Plastics at
      <strong>
       Guildford
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing Court is company director and part-owner Guilherme Roque Rebello.
     </p>
     <p>
      Delahill and Mr Rebello allegedly breached workplace law by failing to comply with a demand to back-pay the two casual factory workers a total of $86,695.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees - a husband-and-wife from Sri Lanka, aged in their 50s - were in Australia on bridging visas and spoke limited English.
     </p>
     <p>
      The husband was allegedly underpaid $10,197 between July, 2009 and June, 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      His wife was allegedly underpaid $76,498 between January, 2010 and September, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments are the result of the employees allegedly being paid flat hourly rates starting at $8 for a probation period and later increasing to $13 to $14.
     </p>
     <p>
      The couple was entitled to normal rates of more than $17 an hour and up to $32 an hour for overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated after receiving a request for assistance from the couple.
     </p>
     <p>
      In April, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice requiring Delahill and Mr Rebello to rectify the underpayment within 28 days – but they did not comply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must adhere to Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency made extensive efforts to resolve the matter voluntarily outside of Court, but was unable to secure sufficient co-operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Delahill faces a maximum penalty of $25,500 and Mr Rebello faces a maximum penalty of $5100. The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for Delahill to back-pay the employees in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman will not tolerate employers failing to promptly back-pay workers who have been underpaid. “We prefer to assist employers to rectify inadvertent non-compliance issues but we are prepared to take legal action against employers who refuse to co-operate,” she said.
