      Ending employment and notice
     </h2>
     <p>
      When starting an apprenticeship, the employer and apprentice should talk about whether the apprentice will stay on at the salon when the apprenticeship is completed. It’s important to talk about your intentions early on because it could determine whether an apprentice gets notice of termination.
     </p>
     <p>
      A notice period is the length of time that an employee or employer has to give to end employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      An apprentice will have to give or get notice of termination when they’re quitting or if they’re fired unless they're:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employed for a set period of time or task, or
      </li>
      <li>
       fired for

       </a>
       .
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If an apprentice is only going to be employed for the time of their apprenticeship they won't get notice of termination when it ends.
     </p>
     <p>
      It can help to look at an employee's employment contract to see if they've been employed for a set period of time or task.

      <li>
       work trials - testing a person's job skills

      In 2014 we reviewed workplace law challenges in the hairdressing industry. We found the most common workplace issues in this industry are the topics covered on this page.
