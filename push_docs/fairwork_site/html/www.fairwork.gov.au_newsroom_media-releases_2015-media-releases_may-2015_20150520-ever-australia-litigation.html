      <strong>

      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An ugg boot retailer will face court for allegedly paying an overseas worker in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      just $8 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Chinese national, in her late 20s, was in Australia on a 417 working holiday visa when she was employed as a casual salesperson.
     </p>
     <p>
      She was allegedly short-changed more than $4200 over just two months in April and June last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker was allegedly paid only $8 an hour to staff pop-up stores at shopping centres at
      <strong>
       Wetherill Park
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Merrylands
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Winston Hills
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Chester Hill
      </strong>
      in Sydney’s western suburbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      She was entitled to more than $22 for normal hours, penalty rates up to $32 for weekend work and $43 an hour on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman announced today it had commenced legal action against
      <strong>
       Strathfield
      </strong>
      man Yue Hua Liu and a company in which he is the majority shareholder, Ever Australia Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company manufactures and sells ugg boots and other products under the ‘Ever UGG’ brand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says Mr Liu had previously been warned about paying unlawful, low flat rates of pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2013, Mr Liu was required to back-pay two other overseas workers more than $9000 after he had similarly paid them just $8 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Liu gave an undertaking at the time that he would pay minimum lawful entitlements in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      He faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Ever Australia faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter will be heard in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the underpayment of vulnerable overseas workers is a serious matter and she takes a dim view of employers who allegedly continue to flout the law after being educated about their workplace obligations.

     <p>
      Information to assist people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds has been translated into 27 languages. Overseas workers can call
      <strong>

      </strong>
      if they need interpreter services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has fact sheets tailored to overseas workers and international students on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency has also produced videos in 14 different languages and posted them on YouTube to assist overseas workers understand their workplace rights in Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says 417 visa-holders have emerged as a strong priority for the Fair Work Ombudsman and their wages and conditions are the subject of a national Inquiry launched last August.
