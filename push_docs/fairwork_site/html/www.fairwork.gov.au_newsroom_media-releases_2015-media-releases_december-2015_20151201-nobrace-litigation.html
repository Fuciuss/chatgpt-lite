      <strong>
       1 December 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An international student studying dentistry in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      was allegedly underpaid tens of thousands of dollars after being recruited by a dental clinic in the CBD.
     </p>
     <p>
      The female student, from South Korea, was recruited by the Nobrace Dental Clinic on a 457 skilled worker visa on a nominated annual salary of $50,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, documents lodged with the Federal Circuit Court allege the woman, in her late 20s, was paid a flat rate of just $15 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has announced legal proceedings against the former operators of the Nobrace Dental Clinic,
      <strong>
       Kooyong
      </strong>
      couple Dr Ari Masters and his wife Christine, and their company.
     </p>
     <p>
      In its Statement of Claim, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges the employee was short-changed a total of $66,945 between April, 2011 and February, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Health Professionals and Support Services Award
      </em>
      , the employee should have been paid between $16.90 and $18.93 for normal hours and up to $37.85 an hour for overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the alleged underpayment when it investigated a request for assistance from the visa-holder.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors allegedly found that tax deductions from the employee’s wages were based on her nominated salary, not what she was actually paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      False time-and-wages records for the employee were also allegedly created to give the impression the employee was paid her nominated salary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace laws relating to pay-slips, payment of annual leave entitlements and employee records were also allegedly breached and a Notice to Produce records was not complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence legal action because of the seriousness of the alleged breaches and the involvement of a vulnerable overseas worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dr Masters and Mrs Masters face maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and their company up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking a Court Order for full back-payment of the employee and an injunction restraining the couple from underpaying health industry workers in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       NOTE
      </strong>
      : Nobrace Centre Pty Ltd has sold the Nobrace Centre dental clinic in the Melbourne CBD and the current owners are not involved in the proceedings above.
