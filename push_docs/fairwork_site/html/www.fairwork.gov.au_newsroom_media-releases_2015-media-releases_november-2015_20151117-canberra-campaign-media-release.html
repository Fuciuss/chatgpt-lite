       The Fair Work Ombudsman is auditing up to 50 businesses in
       <strong>
        Canberra
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Queanbeyan
       </strong>
       as part of a new campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors are checking employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations is also being monitored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The campaign is focusing on employers across various sectors, including computer system design, superannuation funds, road freight transport, carpentry, hospitality, sport and camping stores, accounting, landscaping, building construction, cleaning, hairdressing and beauty and real estate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In Canberra, inspectors are focusing on
       <strong>
        Woden
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Weston Creek.
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       All businesses are being randomly selected.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says one of the campaign’s aims is to ensure employers are aware of their responsibilities and how the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Inspectors are making
      </span>
      <span>
       face-to-face
      </span>
      <span>
       visits to 40 per cent of businesses selected for the campaign so they can offer assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Key local employer groups have been enlisted to assist the Agency to promote the campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at fairwork.gov.au
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Resources include
      </span>
      <span>
       templates for time-and-wages records and
      </span>
      <span>
       a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers and employees seeking assistance can also contact the Fair Work Infoline on
       <strong>
        13 13 94
       </strong>
       . A free interpreter service is available by calling
       <strong>
        13 14 50
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Small business can opt to be put through to a small business helpline, which has now assisted more than 250,000 callers since it was established.
