     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the campaign area is home to hundreds of businesses and is a persistent source of requests for assistance from workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be proactive about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Inspectors will make face-to-face visits to dozens of businesses during the campaign so they can offer employers tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Key local employer groups have been enlisted to assist the Agency to promote the campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Resources available include templates for time-and-wages records and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The My Account tool allows users to save tailored information such as pay rates and conditions of employment specific to their circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
