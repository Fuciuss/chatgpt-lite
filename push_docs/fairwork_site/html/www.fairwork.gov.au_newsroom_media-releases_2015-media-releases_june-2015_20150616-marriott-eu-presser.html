       More than 120 former employees at the
       <strong>
        Newcastle
       </strong>
       airport are to be back-paid more than $472,000 after it was found they were being short-changed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       They worked at the Sports Bar and Bistro and Hungry Jacks before the businesses closed in March.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       One employee was underpaid more than $28,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Wage errors were uncovered after one of the workers approached the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The former owner-operator of the two businesses, Marriott Airport Concessions Pty Ltd, was mistakenly paying its casual staff a flat hourly rate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Staff should have been paid according to the terms of the Restaurant Industry Award and the Fast Food Industry Award.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee who first complained was short-changed $15,596 over three years to November, 2013.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Follow-up calculations revealed that 123 employees engaged between July 1, 2010 and January 10, 2014 had been underpaid a total of $472,258.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Marriott has so far back-paid $74,671 and has committed to reimbursing all outstanding entitlements over two years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The company has also entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman to revamp its workplace practices.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This includes an independent audit of the wages of at least 30 per cent of its casual employees once a year for the next three years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Managers will be required to undergo training on workplace obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the issue highlights how a mistake left over time can result in a hefty bill for back-payment of wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “This matter demonstrates how lack of awareness or ignorance of minimum wages and conditions can potentially have a negative financial impact on the business.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It should also show how our intervention can assist employers to become compliant and minimise potential negative effects on business if workplace laws are not observed.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers uncertain about whether their workplace practices are appropriate should visit

       for advice.
