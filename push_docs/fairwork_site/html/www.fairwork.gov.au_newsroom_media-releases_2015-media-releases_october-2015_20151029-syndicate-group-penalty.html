      <strong>

     </p>
     <p>
      A high-wage earning
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      business operator has been fined for a second time after again being involved in short-changing employees thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Claudio Locaso has been fined $4845 – and his marketing and distribution company, The Syndicate Group Pty Ltd, has been fined a further $12,750.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties were imposed in the Federal Circuit Court after Locaso and his company admitted breaching workplace laws by failing to back-pay four underpaid employees a total of $9622 in 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court also ordered Locaso’s company to back-pay the employees in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two of the underpaid employees, who travelled door-to-door offering free power boards and free installation, were paid nothing for approximately two and three weeks’ work, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the employees was aged just 20.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties come three months after Locaso and Jonathan Paul William Stielow were each fined $11,880 and criticised in Court for paying themselves wages totalling almost $500,000, while short-changing eight door-to-door sales employees almost $15,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties in both matters are the result of investigations and legal actions by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Norah Hartnett found that the latest breaches were part of a “broader pattern of conduct by Mr Locaso”.
     </p>
     <p>
      In both matters, Locaso’s companies were contracted to install power boards in homes as part of the Victorian Government’s Victorian Energy Efficiency Target Scheme.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors tried to avoid having to take legal action by issuing Compliance Notices requesting back-payment - but the notices were ignored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Hartnett said a contact centre manager who had been underpaid $4000 in the most recent matter had complained that the underpayment had caused him financial stress and that he ‘did not have a place to stay from 1 November, 2013’.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Hartnett said the penalty should mark disapproval of Locaso’s conduct and serve as a warning to others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Noting that the Victorian Energy Efficiency Target Scheme is widespread and ongoing, Judge Hartnett said: “The imposition of a penalty in this matter will assist in ensuring other providers operating within that scheme are aware of, and compliant with, their employment obligations”.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court’s decision sends a message that employers refusing to back-pay employees they have underpaid will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are increasingly issuing Compliance Notices to try to resolve underpayment matters outside of the Court – but we are prepared to commence legal action against employers who refuse to co-operate,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Compliance Notice.
