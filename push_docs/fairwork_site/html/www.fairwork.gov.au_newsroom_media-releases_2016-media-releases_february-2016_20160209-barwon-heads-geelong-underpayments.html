      <strong>
       9 February 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former manager of a business at
      <strong>
       Barwon Heads
      </strong>
      in Victoria has been back-paid $19,000 after intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee was paid a flat weekly salary that was not sufficient to cover his penalty rates or entitlements for working on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the employee was not paid-out more than 300 hours of accumulated annual leave when his employment ended.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business also failed to keep proper records for the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the underpayment when they investigated a request for assistance from the former employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate case, a recent random audit at a
      <strong>
       Geelong
      </strong>
      eatery has revealed that two employees were underpaid a total of $6600.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the workers was an Indian national employed as a cook on a 457 skilled worker visa. She was underpaid $4700.
     </p>
     <p>
      After being contacted by Fair Work inspectors, both businesses back-paid their employees in full without the need for enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers must ensure they are aware of the minimum hourly wage rates and penalty rates that apply to their employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Simply putting an employee on a salary or a flat rate does not relieve an employer of the obligation to ensure that all Award entitlements are being met,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employers also need to be aware that they must maintain proper employment records and issue pay-slips on a timely basis.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman recovered $22.3 million for 11,613 underpaid workers nationally in the 2014-15 financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of this, $7.59 million was recovered for 4809 workers in
      <strong>
       Victoria
      </strong>
      , including $268,000 for 83 workers in the
      <strong>
       Geelong
      </strong>
      area.
