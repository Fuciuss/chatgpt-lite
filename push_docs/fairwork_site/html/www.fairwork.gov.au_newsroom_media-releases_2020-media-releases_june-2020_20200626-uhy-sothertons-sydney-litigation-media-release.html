     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against the former operator of a Sydney accounting firm, UHY Sothertons Sydney Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      UHY Sothertons Sydney operated an accounting firm in Bondi Junction until it sold the business to another company in April 2019.
     </p>
     <p>
      UHY Sothertons Sydney had employed four employees, all of whom had their employment terminated when the business was sold.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that under the terms of the sale agreement, UHY Sothertons Sydney was responsible for paying out the employees’ final entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the employees lodged requests for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work inspector issued a Compliance Notice after forming a belief that the employees had not been paid their accrued but untaken annual leave entitlements under the National Employment Standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulator alleges the company failed to comply with the Compliance Notice which required it to calculate and back-pay entitlements owing to the four employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said that the regulator will enforce workplace laws in a proportionate manner during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that includes continuing to take businesses to court where lawful requests are not complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, Compliance Notices are important tools used by inspectors if they form a belief that an employer has breached workplace laws,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Where employers do not comply with a Compliance Notice, we will take appropriate action to protect employees. A court can then order them to pay penalties in addition to back-paying workers. Any employees with concerns about their pay should contact us for assistance.”.
     </p>
     <p>
      UHY Sothertons Sydney Pty Ltd faces a penalty of up to $31,500 from the Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a Court Order requiring UHY Sothertons Sydney to comply with the Compliance Notice, which includes rectifying underpayments in full, plus superannuation and interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing has been listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney on 16 July 2020.
