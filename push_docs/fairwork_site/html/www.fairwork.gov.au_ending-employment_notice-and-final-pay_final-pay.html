      When to pay
     </h2>
     <p>
      Most awards say that employers need to pay employees their final payment within 7 days of the employment ending. Employment contracts, enterprise agreements or other registered agreements can also specify when final pay must be paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee's award, contract or agreement doesn't say when an employee's final pay must be paid, then it's best practice for an employee to be paid within 7 days of their employment ending.

      Employment separation certificates
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Department of Human Services sometimes requires employers to complete an Employment Separation Certificate when an employee stops working for them. This certificate needs to include information about final pay payments. For information about giving or receiving separation certificates, go to the

      You can use some of our tools to help you work out what money is owed in a final pay payment.

      Use our

      to find your award and pay rate, including penalty rates and allowances.

      If you’re covered by an enterprise agreement, you can find enterprise agreements on the

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee gets annual leave loading during employment then it also has to be paid out when employment ends. Annual leave loading is paid out even when an award, registered agreement or employment contract says that it’s not.

      Find information about other entitlements relating to final pay in your award by selecting from the list below.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Notice and redundancy
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whether an employee quits or is fired, notice is generally required.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most awards say that an employer can deduct up to one week’s wages from an employee’s pay if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee is over 18
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee hasn’t given the right amount of notice under their award
      </li>
      <li>
       the deduction isn’t unreasonable.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      However, employers can only deduct pay from wages owed under the award. They can’t deduct from other entitlements owed to the employee, such as accumulated leave or other overaward payments.
     </p>
