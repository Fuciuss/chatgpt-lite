      <strong>
       5 September 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the results of an investigation into alleged exploitation of staff working in karaoke bars in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Twenty-five Fair Work inspectors made surprise visits to five karaoke bars last October as part of a Taskforce Cadena* operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      All five businesses – three in Perth and two in Melbourne - were in breach of their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each employer was issued with a Compliance Notice and three received on-the-spot fines.
     </p>
     <p>
      All operators have received a formal Letter of Caution from the Fair Work Ombudsman placing them on notice that further contraventions may result in legal action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost $11,000 was recovered for 19 employees who were short-changed their minimum wages for a sample period between September 28 and November 11 last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments were primarily the result of the staff employed to serve patrons and set up the karaoke rooms being underpaid their minimum hourly rate, casual loading and penalties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell says karaoke bars were targeted for attention after intelligence and research assembled by Taskforce Cadena.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Karaoke bars have allegedly been connected to illegal brothels, prostitution, human trafficking, links to organised crime syndicates and non-compliance with workplace laws,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Intelligence indicates that many karaoke hostesses are either recent migrants or foreign nationals in Australia on tourist, student, 417 or 457 visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      “There is also a possibility that some staff may either be illegal immigrants or have been trafficked to Australia to work.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell said the Fair Work Ombudsman had not had extensive dealings with the karaoke industry in the past, but put this down to a likely reluctance on the part of employees to seek help for fear of jeopardising their visa status.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said Taskforce Cadena had received information which suggested the industry operated under a cash economy, which was generally indicative of wage, tax and superannuation contraventions and potential exploitation of workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The initial focus of our sites visits was to determine compliance with the employment conditions of workers engaged as karaoke hostesses,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whilst on site, it became apparent that some businesses did not directly engage hostesses, but employed staff to serve patrons and set up the karaoke rooms.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Information gleaned on the night suggests that if karaoke patrons wanted a hostess to visit their room, they were provided with a phone number to call and order the service, and the patrons would pay the girl direct.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Where employees were directly engaged by the business, we found workplace contraventions in relation to wages, record-keeping and pay-slip obligations.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell said the co-operation of the employers, their directors and legal representatives during the investigation was “limited, but sufficient”.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said Fair Work inspectors found poor workplace practices in relation to the clarity of employee status, record-keeping, rosters of hours worked, calculation and payment of wages and provision of pay-slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meal allowances were also not paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors interviewed 30 employees during the site visits.
     </p>
     <p>
      “None were prepared to go beyond providing brief information in relation to their employment or the practices of the business,” Mr Campbell revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Some employees also provided information which contradicted their employer, giving rise to concerns about possible deception and coercion by the employer.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell said the karaoke bar employers had a “rudimentary, at best” understanding of their obligations under federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said there were indications that employers retrospectively created pay-slips and paid tax after the site visits in an apparent effort to conceal, or at least lessen the true underpayment of wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell said that on top of providing potentially false and misleading records, employers raised suspicions about their behaviour by refusing to participate in a formal Record of Interview with Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The investigation was also impacted by the limited engagement of employees, who despite being aware they were underpaid, did not wish to assist Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Employees reported being concerned that the employer would retaliate in some way or that they may face other repercussions,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Some employees were just thankful that they had a job and that the rates of pay they received were still higher than what they hear other employees are paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It appeared as though some workers were not interested in getting back-payment of wages or assisting us to change their employer’s behaviour … it was not worth the risk of the perceived consequences.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell said all five businesses had been earmarked for follow-up visits in six months to assess whether they were compliant.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said the findings were being shared by Taskforce Cadena and would contribute to planning for future activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman recovered more than $3 million in underpaid wages and entitlements for 687 visa-holders last financial year.
