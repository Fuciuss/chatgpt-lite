      <strong>
       17 February 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of cleaners in
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      have been underpaid tens of thousands of dollars, spot checks by the Fair Work Ombudsman have found.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifty-three cleaners – including young workers and overseas workers – were found to have been short-changed almost $84,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the result shows the need for local cleaning contractors to pay greater attention to wage rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors randomly checked 14 Darwin cleaning businesses last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auditing has concluded, and the findings are released today.
     </p>
     <p>
      One employer underpaid six workers a total of $38,200 - an average of more than $6300 each - as a result of paying a flat hourly rate of $19.
     </p>
     <p>
      The flat rate resulted in underpayment of casual loadings and penalty rates for weekend, shift and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors found many businesses were failing to comply with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations and were not providing a copy of the Fair Work Information Statement to new employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only one business was fully compliant with Commonwealth workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that while it was disappointing to find a number of underpayments, it was pleasing that all employers rectified non-compliance issues and accepted assistance to remedy their mistakes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some employers raised concerns that paying the correct wages made their businesses uncompetitive, particularly when competing for new contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We assured those businesses that audits like this not only protect employees – but also help to ensure that businesses doing the right thing can compete on a level playing field,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The cleaning industry is very competitive and the responsibility for ensuring workers are being paid correctly is not the cleaning contractors’ alone.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is not acceptable for organisations to outsource work to the lowest-cost cleaning contractor without considering whether the low price paid is likely to result in workers ultimately being underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Such behaviour is not only unethical, but it may be unlawful. It can also potentially expose managers and their company to financial penalties.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 550 of the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      provides for accessorial liability, a mechanism through which someone other than the employer who is involved in a contravention of workplace laws may be held accountable.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a keynote address late last year titled “Risk, Reputation and Responsibility”, Ms James flagged that the Agency would increasingly use Section 550 of the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      to go up and down the supply chain to scrutinise sub-contracting arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      She warned that companies found to be profiting from underpaying workers faced a “very real risk to reputation and impact on their bottom line”.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says all parties should undertake due diligence when outsourcing work, particularly to lowest-cost providers, to ensure lower costs are attributable to efficiencies in the business and not the potential exploitation of workers on below-award rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will shortly release the results of a national campaign on the cleaning industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cleaning industry was selected for attention because it continues to be a persistent source of requests for assistance from employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also tends to employ a significant number of overseas workers, unskilled workers and temporary employees, many of whom can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their workplace rights, or reluctant to complain.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a national campaign in 2010, the Fair Work Ombudsman found that 149 of 376 cleaning businesses (40 per cent) breached workplace laws and recovered almost $500,000 for more than 900 workers nationally.

      Online tools available at www.fairwork.gov.au
      <strong>
      </strong>
      include PayCheck Plus to determine the correct award and minimum wages for employees, templates for pay slips and time-and-wages records and a range of fact sheets on workplace entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will re-visit the Darwin employers found to be non-compliant within six months to ensure they are meeting their workplace obligations on an ongoing basis.
