      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of a recent campaign in the
      <strong>
       ACT
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Spot checks of 76 local businesses found:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       43 (57 per cent) were compliant with all their workplace responsibilities,
      </li>
      <li>
       57(75 per cent) were paying their employees correctly, and
      </li>
      <li>
       58 (76 per cent) were compliant with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Nineteen businesses were asked to back-pay a total of $16,385 to 24 of their employees who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      One employer, the operator of a Nando’s restaurant, signed an Enforceable Undertaking with the Fair Work Ombudsman after it was revealed the business had underpaid its workers more than $27,000.
