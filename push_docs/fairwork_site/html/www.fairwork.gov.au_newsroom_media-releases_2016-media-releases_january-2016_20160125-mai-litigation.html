      <strong>
       25 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Another 7-Eleven store in
      <strong>
       Brisbane
      </strong>
      has allegedly been short-changing its workers tens of thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has announced legal action against the operators of a 7-Eleven outlet on Boundary Road, West End.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is franchisee Sheng-Chieh Lo and his company Mai Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman claims 12 staff, including international students, were underpaid a total of $82,661 in the year to September, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Boundary Road store was one of 20 7-Eleven stores targeted for surprise night-time visits as part of a tri-State operation in September, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The litigation takes to seven the number of 7-Eleven operators to face Court since 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier this month, the Fair Work Ombudsman announced legal proceedings against the operators of two other 7-Eleven outlets in the Brisbane CBD.

        More 7-Eleven store operators face Court for allegedly short-changing employees
       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It is alleged that Mr Lo paid flat hourly rates as low as $13 an hour and tried to conceal the underpayments by creating false employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Lo allegedly made false entries into the 7-Eleven head office payroll system.
     </p>
     <p>
      He and his company allegedly also knowingly provided false time-and-wage records to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      When Fair Work inspectors confronted Mr Lo with evidence of the underpayments, he provided bank records to indicate he had back-paid the employees, according to documents filed with the Federal Circuit Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that these documents were false or misleading because they did not show that many of the employees had allegedly repaid those amounts to Mr Lo.
     </p>
     <p>
      In one instance, Mr Lo allegedly received money from an employee in advance, which he then transferred into their account.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the alleged breaches are extremely serious, as is the involvement of vulnerable overseas workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says 7-Eleven is the subject of a national Inquiry by the Fair Work Ombudsman into allegations of systemic underpayments and false record-keeping practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says a final report is expected in the first quarter of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Lo faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Mai Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for Mai Pty Ltd to fully back-pay the workers any outstanding amounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged the employees were underpaid total amounts ranging from $1673 to $21,966.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking injunctions restraining Mr Lo and his company from underpaying workers in future and from seeking or accepting any back-payment of wages from current or former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders are also being sought for Mai Pty Ltd to display an in-store notice informing employees of entitlements and to undertake an audit of its compliance with workplace laws and report the results to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane on February 29.
