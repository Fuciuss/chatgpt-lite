      <strong>
       26 April 2016

     <p>
      A wholesale business in Western Sydney is back-paying a sales manager more than $31,000 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The male employee in his 50s, who worked for the
      <strong>
       Chester Hill
      </strong>
      business for 18 years, requested assistance after he was not paid his full entitlements upon resignation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee was not paid-out his outstanding wages, annual leave entitlements, travel allowances and long service leave entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      After a Fair Work officer contacted the business and explained its obligations, the business agreed to back-pay the employee, without the need for further action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business was advised that paying termination entitlements is not negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is crucial small businesses take termination entitlements into consideration, especially if they have long-serving employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are serious about building knowledge and strongly focused on ensuring employers understand their workplace rights and obligations,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Small to medium-sized businesses without human resources staff can also ensure they are better equipped by accessing the free tools and resources at www.fairwork.gov.au."
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter at
      <strong>
       Northmead
      </strong>
      , three apprentice hairdressers are sharing $5200 back-pay after their employer miscalculated their wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer was unaware of the correct minimum pay rates for apprentices.
     </p>
     <p>
      An adult apprentice was paid the junior minimum hourly rates of $11.78 on weekdays and $15.66 on Saturdays, when she was entitled to receive $18.99 and $25.26, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business also underpaid a school-based apprentice for time spent in training and it underpaid a junior apprentice's minimum wage rate, having failed to pass on a wage increase from July 1, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the underpayments during a pro-active audit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that while she was encouraged the employers had co-operated and were reimbursing employees, they are now "on notice" of the need to comply in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Employers must be aware that complying with workplace laws is not optional," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Employers must ensure they are aware of the minimum pay rates that apply to staff."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit www.fairwork.gov.au
