      <strong>
       29 July 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has flagged ongoing efforts to improve compliance rates within the building and construction industry following a recent national campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       While an improvement in compliance over the past five years is encouraging, the industry will remain a high priority for the Agency, Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said today.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James released the findings of random audits of 700 businesses throughout Australia as part of a 2014-15 National Building and Construction Industry Campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The latest auditing found that 75 per cent of employers were paying their employees correctly.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Seventy-seven per cent of employers were compliant with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations and 59 per cent of businesses were compliant with all requirements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors scrutinised 700 employers to check minimum wage rates, penalty rates, allowances, overtime, pay-slip,  record-keeping obligations and contracting arrangements
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ninety-six employers were found to have underpaid a total of 201 employees almost $260,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The largest amount required to be reimbursed by any one business was $58,000.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says four employers have been issued with formal Letters of Caution, putting them on notice that further workplace breaches may result in enforcement action.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors found no prima-facie evidence of inappropriate contracting activity by any of the employers who had their contracting arrangements reviewed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, Ms James says that given the complexities of some of the arrangements examined, further investigations will be conducted to ensure their bona fides.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman earmarked the building and construction sector for attention after assessing its complaints data and in light of the results of previous campaigns.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In the 2013 calendar year, the Agency received 2083 requests for assistance from employees in the construction industry, of which 1027 were sustained, resulting in a 49 per cent contravention rate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Six regional campaigns since 2009, which audited more than 500 businesses, resulted in an overall contravention rate of 65 per cent.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       And between January and June, 2014, the Fair Work Ombudsman received 770 requests for assistance from apprentices – 38 per cent from apprentices in the building and construction industry.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says that in the most recent campaign, trade-qualified employees tended to be paid above their minimum entitlements, and most underpayments related to low-skilled workers reliant on Award conditions.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Of note, 64 per cent of businesses who belonged to employer bodies were compliant, compared with 57 per cent for those who were not,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman will continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Some of those with contraventions will be re-audited in this financial year’s National Compliance Monitoring program to ensure behavioural change.
