      <strong>
       14 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has announced legal action against the operators of two more 7-Eleven stores for allegedly underpaying their staff tens of thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The litigations take to six the number of 7-Eleven operators to face Court since 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest matters to go before the Federal Circuit Court allege that two 7-Eleven outlets in the
      <strong>
       Brisbane CBD
      </strong>
      short-changed 21 employees more than $31,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is Jason Yuan, who operates stores at 231 George Street and 174 Adelaide Street and two companies he part-owns, Vipper Pty Ltd and Viplus Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      In its Statement of Claim, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges 21 employees across the two stores were underpaid a total of $31,507 between September, 2013 and September, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees, including a number of international students, were allegedly paid flat rates as low as $17.74 an hour, resulting in significant underpayment of their penalty rates for shift, Saturday, public holiday, overtime and late-night work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Individual employees are allegedly owed amounts from $98 to $5080.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two stores were among those targeted by the Fair Work Ombudsman for surprise night-time visits as part of a tri-State operation in September, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman had previously advised Mr Yuan in February, 2013 about his obligations to pay lawful minimum penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      He faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vipper Pty Ltd and Viplus Pty Ltd each face penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane on February 22.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says 7-Eleven is the subject of a national Inquiry by the Fair Work Ombudsman into allegations of systemic underpayments and false record-keeping practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says a final report is expected in the first quarter of this year.
