      <strong>
       11 January 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former owner-operator of a transport company is facing Court for allegedly short-changing 12 truck drivers on the
      <strong>
       NSW
      </strong>
      <strong>
       North Coast
      </strong>
      more than $143,000 and using false records to try to disguise the underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against
      <strong>
       Woolgoolga
      </strong>
      man Sumerdeep Singh in the Federal Circuit Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Singh’s now defunct company, Sumer Bagri Pty Ltd, allegedly underpaid the drivers more than $143,000 between 2011 and 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drivers, who delivered groceries in and around
      <strong>
       Coffs Harbour
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
      </strong>
      were allegedly told they would be paid flat hourly rates of between $17 and $23 Monday to Sunday.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drivers were allegedly underpaid their minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, and penalty rates for weekend, overtime and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time, Mr Singh’s company transported groceries ordered online under a contract it had with Linfox Australia Pty Ltd, which had been contracted by Woolworths Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman says the contract price paid by Woolworths to Linfox and the sub-contract price paid by Linfox to Sumer Bagri were sufficient for Mr Singh’s company to pay minimum lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter came to the attention of the Fair Work Ombudsman after a former driver contacted the Agency seeking assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to a Notice to Produce records, Mr Singh allegedly provided Fair Work inspectors with falsified time records that made it appear employees had received higher pay rates than was actually the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      The false records allegedly misstated the number of hours worked by employees and showed Mr Singh had himself performed driving duties during a period when he was actually in India.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence litigation because of the seriousness of the alleged contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Singh faces maximum penalties of between $3400 and $10,200 per contravention. The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order for any penalties imposed to be paid to the allegedly underpaid workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order requiring Mr Singh to complete the ‘Hiring employees’ training course on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website.
     </p>
     <p>
      A penalty hearing is listed for April 12 in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
