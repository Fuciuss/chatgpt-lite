      <strong>
       3 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A young Surfers Paradise worker has been back-paid almost $18,000 after being paid just $12 an hour for nearly a year.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The 22-year-old female employee should have been getting a minimum hourly rate of $23.74, rising to $25.64 on Saturdays and up to $37.98 on Sundays.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, she told the Fair Work Ombudsman that when she asked to be paid her lawful entitlements, the business offered her an extra $1 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employer allegedly told the worker that this was “on a par” with wages being offered by other similar businesses in the area.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       After receiving a phone call from the Fair Work Ombudsman to point out its workplace obligations, the employer is now paying correct wage rates applicable under the
       <em>
        General Retail Industry Award
       </em>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It has also reimbursed her all outstanding entitlements dating back to February, 2015, when the employee was recruited.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has been appropriately educated about its obligations and given information about the free tools and resources on offer at www.fairwork.gov.au
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Employers in Surfers Paradise need to be aware that there are minimum wage rates, they apply to all workers, and they are not negotiable,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She says that because the retail employer has co-operated, agreed to repay all money owed and ensure ongoing compliance with its obligations, it has avoided enforcement action.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and assisting them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Modern Award, as well as classification and pay rates, including base pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James said the Fair Work Ombudsman was striving to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
