      <strong>
       6 August 2014

     </p>
     <p>
      The operator of a hair and beauty salon in western
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      breached workplace laws by failing to back-pay an underpaid employee more than $4600, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is Hair Industrie Mt Druitt Pty Ltd, which operates at the Westfield Mt Druitt complex.
     </p>
     <p>
      A hairdresser at the business was allegedly underpaid a total of $4668 - including minimum wages, penalty rates and leave entitlements - between July, 2012 and February, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the alleged underpayment when they investigated a request for assistance from the employee, aged in her 50s.
     </p>
     <p>
      In April this year, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice that required the underpayment to be rectified within 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that the company did not respond to either the Notice or a follow-up letter from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, companies must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business to try to resolve the matter by agreement, but were not able to secure sufficient co-operation,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company faces a maximum penalty of $25,500 and the Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for the company to back-pay the employee in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said Fair Work inspectors identify underpayments at thousands of businesses nationally each year and resolve the vast majority by working co-operatively with employers, guiding them through the back-payment process and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they pay their staff correctly in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work inspectors will consider compliance action, including issuing Compliance Notices, which lawfully require employers to take prompt action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important for employers to understand that when a Compliance Notice is issued, the Fair Work Ombudsman is simply seeking to recover wages that should have been paid in the first instance - we are not seeking to be punitive,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Compliance Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Enforcing Compliance Notices is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Fair Work inspectors are increasingly issuing Compliance Notices in cases where employers with contravention issues refuse to co-operate and we will not tolerate these Compliance Notices being ignored.”
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of 65 were issued last financial year (2013-14).
