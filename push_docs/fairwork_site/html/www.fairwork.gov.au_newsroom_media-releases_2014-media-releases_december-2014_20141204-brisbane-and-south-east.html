       Workers throughout
       <strong>
        Brisbane
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        South-East Queensland
       </strong>
       have been back-paid more than $82,000 in wages and entitlements following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The biggest recovery was $20,000 for a factory hand at
       <strong>
        Logan City
       </strong>
       underpaid the minimum hourly rate, overtime and weekend penalty rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The underpayments occurred over a nine-month period last year because the employer was not fully aware of the pay rates which applied to the business.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It is important that Queensland employers are aware of the workplace laws that apply to their business, otherwise they can end up facing hefty back-payments they were not budgeting for,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In a separate matter, two waiting staff at a
      </span>
      <strong>
       <span>
        Springfield Lakes
       </span>
      </strong>
      <span>
       restaurant were back-paid a total of $11,000 after being underpaid the minimum hourly rate and penalty rates for weekend and public holiday work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees – an adult and an 18-year-old – were paid flat hourly rates of just $8 and $10 an hour, well below the minimum wage they were entitled to as casual workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Malaysian employer spoke limited English and communicated with Fair Work inspectors through his brother. Because the employer was co-operative and promptly rectified the errors, he was issued with a Letter of Caution and avoided further enforcement action.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has information on its website in 27 languages and offers a free interpreter service to those who need language assistance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>

       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were reimbursed all money owed without the need for further action after Fair Work inspectors contacted the businesses and explained their obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “These cases are an example of our fair and proportionate response to employers who admit their mistakes, back-pay any underpaid employees and work with our inspectors to put processes in place to ensure future compliance,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman can assist employers with accurate, reliable information and encourages local, small businesses to access its free tools and resources.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has a dedicated webpage for small business owners at www.fairwork.gov.au/smallbusiness
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The webpage contains free template documentation for employers to use when hiring, managing and dismissing staff, including letters of engagement and probation, leave application forms and a self-audit check list.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Small business is entitled to credible and reliable information about their obligations in a way that makes sense to them, and via channels that they can access quickly and easily,” Ms James said.
