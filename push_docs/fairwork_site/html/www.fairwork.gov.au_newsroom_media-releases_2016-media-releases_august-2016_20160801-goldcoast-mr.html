       A
       <strong>
        Gold Coast
       </strong>
       family business that withheld the entitlements of two employees is back-paying them $56,000 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The two workers were terminated without being paid their annual leave entitlements for nine years of service, or wages in lieu of notice.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       After educating the employer about its workplace obligations, the Fair Work Ombudsman worked with the business to come up with a repayment plan with monthly instalments.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Other recent recoveries for employees on the Gold Coast include:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        $29,300 for two full-time employment consultants working for a
        <strong>
         Southport
        </strong>
        business who did not receive their termination entitlements and final wages,
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $8600 for a male engineer at
        <strong>
         Ormeau
        </strong>
        who was underpaid his swing shift allowance, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $6600 for a full-time automotive business manager in
        <strong>
         Southport
        </strong>
        who did not receive payment in lieu of notice of termination, annual leave and annual leave loading.

       James says
      </span>
      <span>
       employers must undertake their own checks of Award provisions and periodically ensure their compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Modern Award, as well as classification and pay rates, including base pay rates, allowances, overtime, penalty rates and entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and assisting them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again.”
