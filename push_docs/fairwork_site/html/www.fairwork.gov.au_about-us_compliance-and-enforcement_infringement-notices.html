      What is an infringement notice
     </h2>
     <p>
      An infringement notice is similar to an on-the-spot fine. It can be issued by a Fair Work Inspector (FWI) to an employer who doesn't follow its record-keeping and pay slip obligations under Australian workplace laws including:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       not making or keeping time and wage records
      </li>
      <li>
       not including the right information on a pay slip or employee record
      </li>
      <li>
       not issuing pay slips within 1 working day of paying employees
      </li>
      <li>
       advertising a job that would undercut employees’ minimum entitlements.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      It's important for employers to keep accurate records to avoid fines and so employees and FWIs can check that employees are getting the correct entitlements.

      When an infringement notice can be issued
     </h2>
     <p>
      An infringement notice can be issued any time an employer doesn't follow a workplace law relating to record-keeping or pay slips. This includes the first time a problem occurs. An infringement notice can be issued for 1 or more breaches. When deciding whether to issue an infringement notice an FWI may consider factors such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       if it's the first time the employer hasn't followed a workplace law
      </li>
      <li>
       how serious the breach of the workplace law is
      </li>
      <li>
       if the employer intentionally didn't follow the workplace law
      </li>
      <li>
       if the employer didn't keep the right records to avoid paying employees what they're owed.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If an FWI decides not to issue an infringement notice, the FWI might find another way to help the employer fix the problem. The FWI may check that the problem has been fixed at a later date.
     </p>
     <p>
      An FWI who decides to issue an infringement notice has to do so within 12 months after the day the breach happened.

      Result of paying or not paying the fine in an infringement notice
     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employer pays the fine in an infringement notice on time, it doesn’t mean:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       they've admitted to any breaches of the law, or
      </li>
      <li>
       it’s been found they haven’t followed the law.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We also can’t take them to court for the specific breaches in the notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if an employer doesn't pay the fine within the required time, we may take them to court for the breaches in the notice. If it goes to court, higher penalties could apply.
