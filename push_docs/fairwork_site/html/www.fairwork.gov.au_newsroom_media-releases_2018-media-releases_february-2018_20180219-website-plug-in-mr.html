      It is now easier than ever for overseas workers and linguistically diverse communities to find out about their workplace rights and obligations, with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website now accessible in 40 languages other than English.

      Visitors to www.fairwork.gov.au can now instantly translate website information, as well as fact sheets and Best Practice Guides, with just the click of a button.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new functionality is the latest in a series of initiatives by the regulator, aimed at making it easier for people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to seek workplace assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said that her agency is strongly committed to ensuring that all people working in Australia are equipped with the tools and information they need to stand up for their workplace rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Language barriers can represent a significant obstacle to workers seeking to find out what their rights and entitlements are, knowing where and how to seek help with workplace issues, or having the confidence to speak up,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We know that this can leave workers vulnerable to exploitation and we see far too many examples where people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, particularly visa holders, are treated unfairly and unlawfully in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We also want to ensure that new arrivals who are interested in starting businesses in Australia have easy access to the information they need to comply with workplace laws.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said that the real-time translated content would enable those with limited English skills to more easily find the information that they need, when they need it.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are here to help all employers and employees in Australia to understand their workplace rights and obligations – regardless of which language they speak,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The new website functionality follows the launch of six

       in-language videos
      </a>
      in November last year, aimed at raising awareness of Australian workplace laws amongst visa-holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier last year, Natalie James wrote an

       open letter
      </a>
      to international students urging them to speak up if they have any concerns in relation to their employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      This followed the launch of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s popular

      in 16 languages other than English, which allows visa-holders to report workplace concerns anonymously to the agency in their own language.
