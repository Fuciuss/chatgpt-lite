      A restaurant on Queensland’s
      <strong>
       Gold Coast
      </strong>
      has been penalised a total of $15,300 for refusing to reimburse a teenage apprentice who had been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gold Coast man Meyjitte Boughenout, who owns and operates Absynthe Restaurant in Surfers Paradise, was fined $2550.
     </p>
     <p>
      His company, Absynthe Restaurant Pty Ltd, received a further $12,750 penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court decision follows legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman put the matter before the Court last year after making repeated requests to Boughenout and his company to respond to a Compliance Notice requiring them to back-pay an 18-year-old apprentice chef $4195.
     </p>
     <p>
      They have since done so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors unless they have a reasonable excuse, or make a Court application to challenge the Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The apprentice had complained to the Fair Work Ombudsman after being underpaid wages and annual leave entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Michael Jarrett found that the Fair Work Ombudsman had issued the Compliance Notice in an effort resolve the underpayment matter in a way that avoided the cost to the public purse associated with Court action.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Judge Jarrett said Boughenout and his company had “demonstrated a deliberate disregard” for workplace laws by failing to comply, and had shown no contrition or remorse.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The respondents did nothing except engage in what might be described as obfuscation and avoidance,” Judge Jarrett said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Jarrett said that the penalty “serves as a warning to others” that disregarding Compliance Notices “may come with a heavy price”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Recipients of such a notice should be left under no misapprehension about their obligations to comply with those notices,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia.
