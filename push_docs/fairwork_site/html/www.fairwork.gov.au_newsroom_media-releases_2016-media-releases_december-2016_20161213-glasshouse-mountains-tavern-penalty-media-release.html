      The operators of a Queensland tavern have been penalised a total of $19,500 for causing “significant detriment” to a manager by short-changing her thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Glasshouse Mountains Tavern Pty Ltd, which operates a tavern of the same name in the
      <strong>
       Sunshine Coast hinterland,
      </strong>
      has been penalised $16,500.
     </p>
     <p>
      Company director and part-owner Tammi Maree Pointon has been penalised a further $3000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties, imposed in the Federal Circuit Court, are the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Glasshouse Mountains Tavern and Pointon short-changed a venue manager a total of $6759 in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the underpayment was the result of a failure by the company and Pointon to pay-out the manager’s accrued annual leave entitlements in-full after she resigned and their failure to pay the manager for nine days of personal leave, even though she had provided a medical certificate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company and Pointon also made unlawful deductions from the manager’s wages to cover the cost of a training course and unlawfully imposed a ‘penalty for late notice’ when she resigned, despite the manager providing a notice period that satisfied the period required under the relevant award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the manager lodged a request for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Glasshouse Mountains Tavern back-paid the manager only after the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action and proved the underpayments in Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Michael Baumann found that the underpayment amount for a person in the manager’s position “was a significant detriment” and said the underpayment should have been rectified sooner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Baumann found that there was a need to impose a penalty that encouraged general deterrence and helped to ensure compliance with minimum standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the penalty sends a message about the importance of paying employees’ full termination entitlements when an employment relationship ends.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Paying workers correctly on termination of employment is just as important as ensuring they receive their full entitlements while they are working,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Termination entitlements play a vital supporting role for workers while they attempt to pick themselves up, find a new job and get back on their feet and we are prepared to take enforcement action where necessary to ensure these entitlements are paid in full.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says her Agency is also committed to improving compliance in the hospitality industry. The Fair Work Ombudsman’s three-year National Hospitality Industry Campaign, finalised earlier this year, resulted in more than $2 million being recovered for underpaid employees.
