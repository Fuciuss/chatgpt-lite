      There are clearer laws about asking employees and prospective employees to pay money.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers can’t require an employee or prospective employee to spend their money, or give them (the employer or someone else) money, when:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       it’s unreasonable
      </li>
      <li>
       the payment is for the employer’s benefit, or the benefit of someone related to the employer
      </li>
      <li>
       for the prospective employee, it’s connected to their potential employment.
      </li>
     </ul>

      This applies to any of the employee’s money, not just the pay they get for working.

      Serious contraventions
     </h2>
     <p>
      There are increased penalties for 'serious contraventions' of workplace laws. A serious contravention happens when:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the person or business knew they were contravening an obligation under workplace law
      </li>
      <li>
       the contravention was part of a systematic pattern of conduct affecting one or more people.

      Reverse onus of proof
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employers who don’t meet record-keeping or pay slip obligations and can’t give a reasonable excuse will need to disprove allegations in wage claims made in a court. This is sometimes referred to as a 'reverse onus of proof.'
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee claims there is a breach and the employer didn’t keep the right records, make those records available, or give them a pay slip, the employer needs to prove that they did pay the employee correctly or gave them the right entitlements.

      A FWO Notice is a written document. We can use it to require a person or business to:
