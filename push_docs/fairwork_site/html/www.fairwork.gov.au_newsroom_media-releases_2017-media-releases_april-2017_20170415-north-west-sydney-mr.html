     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has assisted two workers in suburbs north-west of Sydney to recover almost $50,000 in unpaid wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      In one matter, an administration officer at a trade business in
      <strong>
       Macquarie Park
      </strong>
      was not paid her annual leave and long service leave entitlements after she ceased employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The non-payment amounted to $36,923 for 31 days of untaken annual leave and 13 weeks of long service leave which the employee was entitled to under the
      <em>
       Clerks Private Sector Award 2010
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance after waiting for the equivalent of six payment cycles to receive her entitlements.  She became concerned about the length of time it was taking for her entitlements to be paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the Fair Work Ombudsman intervened, the employer promptly reimbursed the worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says paying workers correctly on termination of employment is just as important as ensuring they receive their full entitlements while they are working.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, a cleaner employed by an
      <strong>
       Artarmon
      </strong>
      company was reimbursed $10,188 after intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee was underpaid the applicable shift penalty rates, overtime rates and annual leave entitlements applicable under the
      <em>
       Cleaning Services Award 2010
      </em>
      over a period of two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Award the employee was entitled to receive $27.69 for overtime hours, but her employer continued to pay her at the regular hourly rate of $18.46 for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Natalie James says both businesses avoided enforcement action by co-operating and agreeing to take steps to ensure they comply in the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are striving to build a culture of compliance where businesses understand and comply with their lawful obligations,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We provide free advice and resources to assist employers to understand and comply with their pay and record-keeping obligations.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s online tools and resources can assist employers to determine their applicable Award, as well as classification and pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency provides free advice and resources to assist employers to understand and comply with their pay and record-keeping obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) can assist business owners to calculate pay rates applicable to their business and templates for pay slips and time-and-wages sheets are available for free download.
