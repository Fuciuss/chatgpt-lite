      The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is reminding employers that the national minimum wage has increased today to $19.84 per hour (up from $19.49), or $753.80 per week (up from $740.80).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Commission (FWC) announced a 1.75 per cent increase to the national minimum wage, following its
      <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-agreements/minimum-wages-conditions/annual-wage-reviews/annual-wage-review-2019-20">
       Annual Wage Review
      </a>
      . This increase applies from the first full pay period starting on or after today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees covered by awards will also have base rates increased by 1.75 per cent, however, these increases to award wages begin on three different dates for different groups of awards:

      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said workplaces are expected to ensure all their employees are paid at least the relevant minimum wage, in line with the Fair Work Commission’s decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Fair Work Ombudsman has free online tools available to help employers comply with their workplace obligations, which have been updated to reflect the new pay rates.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “We urge all businesses to use our
      <a href="https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/">
       Pay and Conditions Tool
      </a>
      to check the lawful minimum rates they need to pay their staff, or to contact us directly for free assistance,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We encourage workers to use the
      <a href="https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/">
       Pay and Conditions Tool
      </a>
      to check their rates of pay – and call us if they have any concerns. If workers are unsure which award applies to them, they can use the

     </p>
     <p>
      The new minimum wages will apply to any work an employee performs while they're in the JobKeeper scheme, if they get their pay rate from an award or the national minimum wage. See
