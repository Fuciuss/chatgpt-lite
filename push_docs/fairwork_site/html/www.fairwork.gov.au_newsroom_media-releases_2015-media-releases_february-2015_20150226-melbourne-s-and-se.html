      <strong>
       26 February 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of workers in Melbourne’s South and South-Eastern suburbs have shared in  more than $93,100 back-pay after recent inquiries by the Fair Work Ombudsman revealed they had been underpaid at work.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest recovery was $41,800 for 50 staff at a
      <strong>
       Glen Waverley
      </strong>
      restaurant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman randomly audited the business and found the workers, including bartenders, kitchen hands, cooks and waiting staff, were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and weekend and late-night penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpaid employees included a number of young workers and former staff, with underpayments for individual workers up to $2600.
     </p>
     <p>
      After Fair Work inspectors contacted the business and explained its obligations, the employees were reimbursed all money owed without the need for enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments occurred because the employer had misclassified some workers and was not fully aware of the penalty rates that applied to late-night and weekend shifts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the underpayments should serve to remind all employers about how important it is for them to take the time to ensure they are aware of the minimum pay rates applicable to their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A small mistake left over time can easily result in a hefty bill for back-payment of wages – so it is important employers get it right in the first place,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $14,000 for 25 cleaners at a

     </ul>

      Ms James says the employees were reimbursed all money owed without the need for enforcement action after Fair Work inspectors contacted the businesses and explained their obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We accept that these underpayments were the result of genuine mistakes and it was pleasing to see all business owners accept assistance from Fair Work inspectors to put processes in place to ensure ongoing compliance with workplace law,” she said.
