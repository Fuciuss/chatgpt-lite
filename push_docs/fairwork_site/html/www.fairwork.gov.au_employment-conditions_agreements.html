      There are 3 types of enterprise agreements that can apply to employers and employees collectively. These are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       single-enterprise agreements (covering a single business or enterprise)
      </li>
      <li>
       multi-enterprise agreements (covering more than one business or enterprise)
      </li>
      <li>
       greenfields agreements (covering new enterprises that don’t have any employees yet).
      </li>

       a group of businesses, or

       an individual employee (but these types of agreements can't be made anymore).

     </ul>
     <p>
      If an enterprise agreement or another registered agreement applies to employees in a workplace, no award will apply to those employees. However:

     <ul>
      <li>
       the base pay rate in the agreement can’t be less than the base pay rate in the award
