      <strong>
       2 July 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A migrant factory worker in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      was underpaid almost $16,000 over four years, a Fair Work Ombudsman investigation has found.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The Vietnamese woman, in her 40s, spoke limited English and sought assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman through an interpreter.
     </p>
     <p>
      She worked for
      <strong>
       Dandenong
      </strong>
      -based car components manufacturer Katjen Enterprise Pty Ltd between January, 2010 and May last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Her duties included sewing and gluing vinyl fabrics used in the interior trim of new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the woman was paid a flat hourly rate of $13 for weekend, overtime and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      “However, under the
      <em>
       Vehicle Manufacturing, Repair, Services and Retail Award 2010
      </em>
      , she should have received up to $46.09 an hour,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The minimum hourly rates for ordinary working hours and annual leave entitlements were also underpaid.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says Katjen’s director Ly Khuong Chau, told Fair Work inspectors the employee had agreed to be paid $13 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      “However, employers are not able to enter into agreements that undercut employees’ minimum lawful entitlements,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Katjen and Mr Chau have reimbursed the former employee all her outstanding entitlements and signed an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the EU, Katjen will implement a workplace relations training program for managers and commission external professional audits of its pay practices every six months for the next 18 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Katjen and Mr Chau have also agreed to use the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Online tool My Account and develop systems for ensuring ongoing compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the company will display a workplace notice at its factory detailing its breaches and resolve all future workplace disputes promptly and report details to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman received two other underpayment-related requests for assistance from Katjen employees in 2013. These were voluntarily rectified by the company without the need for further action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the case is a timely reminder to small business operators of the importance of ensuring they take the time to understand the workplace laws applicable to their business.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “Underpayments of hourly rates can result in significant underpayments if they’re left unchecked for an extended period of time,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important that employers who are unsure about their obligations contact the Fair Work Ombudsman, or check with their industry association.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We know workplace laws can seem complicated for the uninitiated, but we ask small business to use the tools and resources that we provide for them and inform themselves.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit www.fairwork.gov.au or contact the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Small business employers calling the Fair Work Infoline can also opt to receive priority service via the Small Business Helpline.
     </p>
     <p>
      An interpreter service is available on
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Information on the website has been translated into 27 languages, including Vietnamese, to assist people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has also produced videos in 14 different languages and posted them on YouTube to assist people from non-English speaking backgrounds to understand Australia’s workplace relations laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman uses Enforceable Undertakings where it has formed a view that a breach of the law has occurred, but where the employer has acknowledged this and accepted responsibility and agreed to co-operate and fix the problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Many of the initiatives included in EUs help to build a greater understanding of workplace responsibilities, motivate the company to do the right thing and help them avoid the same mistakes again,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need encourages and empowers employees and employers to resolve issues in their workplace and build a culture of compliance, ensuring a level playing field for all.”
