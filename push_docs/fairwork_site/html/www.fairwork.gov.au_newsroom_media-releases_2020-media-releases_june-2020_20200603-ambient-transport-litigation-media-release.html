      <strong>
       3 June 2020
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court against Sydney-based passenger transport company, Ambient Transport Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors commenced an investigation after receiving requests for assistance from drivers who had been engaged by Ambient Transport between May and October 2019 to transport passengers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work inspector issued a Compliance Notice after forming a belief that drivers had not received all earnings under the
      <em>
       Passenger Vehicle Transportation Award 2010
      </em>
      , including one employee not receiving any earnings at all, and the company had contravened provisions of the award relating to penalty rates for weekend, early morning, and night work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulator alleges the company failed to comply with the Compliance Notice which required it to calculate and back-pay any outstanding amounts owing to five drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said that the regulator will enforce workplace laws in a proportionate manner during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that includes continuing to take businesses to court where lawful requests are not complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the Fair Work Act, Compliance Notices are important tools used by inspectors if they form a belief that an employer has breached workplace laws,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Where employers do not comply with a Compliance Notice, we will take appropriate action to protect employees. A court can then order them to pay penalties in addition to back-paying workers. Any employees with concerns about their pay should contact us for assistance.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ambient Transport Pty Ltd faces a penalty of up to $31,500 from the Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO is also seeking a Court Order requiring Ambient Transport to comply with the Compliance Notice, which includes rectifying underpayments in full, plus superannuation and interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing has been listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney on 2 October 2020.
