      <strong>
       22 April 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A bicycle courier in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      was underpaid more than $7000 after his employer breached sham contracting laws and misclassified him as an independent contractor, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against
      <strong>
       Bacchus Marsh
      </strong>
      man Vincent John Smits and his business Z Transport Group in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne.
     </p>
     <p>
      Z Transport Group allegedly recruited a bicycle courier in 2013, classified him as an independent contractor and paid him according to the jobs he performed.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, it is alleged the courier, aged in his late 20s, should have been classified as an employee. His duties were controlled and directed by Z Transport Group between 8 am and 5.30 pm each day.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee did not have an Australian Business Number (ABN), did not invoice Z Transport Group to receive payment and was not operating his own independent business.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that the courier was entitled to receive employee entitlements under the
      <em>
       Road Transport and Distribution Award
      </em>
      , including minimum wages and leave entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Z Transport Group therefore allegedly underpaid the courier $7641 between February and November, 2013. Fair Work inspectors investigated after the courier lodged a complaint.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Smits and Z Transport Group allegedly failed to take action after an inspector issued them with a Compliance Notice in September last year requiring full back-payment of the courier within 16 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Breaches of pay slip laws are also alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee was back-paid shortly before the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman had earlier investigated a complaint from another courier in 2012, after which Z Transport was advised of the need to ensure employees were not misclassified as contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Z Transport Group now faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention. Mr Smits faces a maximum penalty of up to $5100.
