     <p>
      A hair product retailer operating two shopping centre kiosks in
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      is facing legal action for allegedly underpaying its workers tens of thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Corioliss Pty Ltd, its director Haim Tomer Diamond and manager Rina Diamond.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that 11 employees, including young workers and overseas workers, were paid an hourly rate of as little as $7.86 an hour plus commission, working at kiosks at the
      <strong>
       Chadstone
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Northland
      </strong>
      Shopping Centres.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman claims the 11 employees were collectively underpaid a total of $34,915 for work variously performed between July, 2014 and January last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest amount allegedly owed to an individual is $4434. The business has commenced rectifying the underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Court documents also allege that in response to a Notice to Produce employment documents, false records were provided to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Corioliss has previously received a Letter of Caution from the Fair Work Ombudsman over its concerns about the company’s workplace practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency is seeking Court Orders requiring the back-payment of the outstanding wages and entitlements in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Orders that Corioliss register with the Agency’s My Account portal and complete the Hiring Employees training module on its Online Learning Centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers need to understand the minimum wage applicable to their workplace and that it is non-negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Corioliss Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention while Haim Diamond and Rina Diamond each face a penalty of up to $10,200 for each contravention alleged against them.
