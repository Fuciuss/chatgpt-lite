      <strong>
       28 August 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s Infoline – which answers hundreds of queries daily from employees and employers about their workplace rights and obligations - has been recognised for its exceptional customer service.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Infoline has been a finalist at the Government Contact Centre Excellence Awards for two years running.
     </p>
     <p>
      But this month it won the 2014 coveted “Best Service” nomination for a call centre with over 30 (full-time equivalent) staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is a credit to the Agency to receive the award and she is extremely proud of the high quality service the Infoline delivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our Advisers are experts in their field and play such a valuable role in educating the Australian community about their rights and obligations under workplace laws,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Infoline has introduced a range of initiatives over the past 12 months to help improve the quality and efficiency of the service, which answered over half a million inquiries last financial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      These include the launch of a dedicated Small Business Helpline, improved quality assurance processes and a public commitment that callers can rely with confidence on the advice they get.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Infoline has also launched an online service called My Account at www.fairwork.gov.au  to enable callers to save the advice they receive, together with any regularly-used website materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We don’t think of calls to our Infoline as a one-off transaction. Through initiatives such as My Account, we’re developing ongoing relationships with our callers to build upon the advice they have received previously and provide a tailored response,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Small Business Helpline, which has taken over 100,000 calls since its launch in December, enables small business owners to be put through to a prioritised queue, reducing waiting times.
     </p>
     <p>
      “When you ring us, and in good faith seek our advice, we expect you to act on that advice. And when you do, if it turns out we have got it wrong, we will acknowledge this and not seek a penalty from you if breaches have occurred as a result,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Infoline Advisers are encouraged to suggest and implement changes that benefit customers, including explaining complex workplace relations issues in everyday language.
     </p>
     <p>
      “All of these changes have made it quicker and easier for people to use our Infoline and resulted in a better customer experience, including shorter wait times,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the past 12 months average wait times on the Infoline have been under 10 minutes. Most questions are about current wage rates, with people in the hair and beauty, hospitality, construction, accommodation, manufacturing and health care industries most likely to call.
     </p>
