      What are enterprise agreements?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Enterprise agreements are legal documents that cover certain employers and employees and set out minimum employment terms and conditions. For more information see

      What is enterprise bargaining?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Enterprise bargaining is the process of negotiating with the goal of making an enterprise agreement. This is generally between the employer or employers, their employees, and their bargaining representatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are rules about this process, including about starting bargaining, the content of enterprise agreements, and how an agreement is made and approved. For more information including the process to make an agreement visit

      Why are the rules changing?
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Government has changed some of the rules to improve access to enterprise agreements and bargaining, including removing barriers to multi-employer bargaining.
     </p>
     <p>
      The changes were introduced as part of the Secure Jobs Better Pay amendments to the Fair Work Act.

      </li>
      <li>
       Multi-enterprise agreements. There are now 3 types of multi-enterprise agreements:
       <ul>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Single interest employer agreements
         </strong>
         for 2 or more employers who are certain franchisees or have common interests and who want to jointly bargain for a single agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Supported bargaining agreements
         </strong>
         which replace the current low-paid bargaining arrangements.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Co-operative workplace agreements
         </strong>
         for employers who have agreed to bargain together in some circumstances.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       Requirements that must be met before a vote on a new or variation to a multi-enterprise agreement.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Please note:
      </strong>
      Single enterprise agreements are currently the most used type of enterprise agreements. The only change to these agreements as part of these amendments are changes to the BOOT.
     </p>
     <p>
      From 6 June 2023 there are also changes to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       bargaining disputes
      </li>
      <li>
       industrial action (protected action ballots).
