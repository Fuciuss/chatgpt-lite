      <strong>
       11 December 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A labour-hire operator in Melbourne who has been the subject of a “litany of complaints” has been fined $42,840 after deliberately underpaying two workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Federal Circuit Court has imposed the penalty against Franco Cardamone following an investigation and legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Cardamone, whose business traded as Howsitgoingmate, underpaid two workers a total of $1970 for short periods of manual work in 2013 and 2014.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He also breached sham contracting laws by knowingly misclassifying one of the employees as a contractor and contravened his pay-slip obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Cardamone also breached workplace laws by failing to respond to two Notices to Produce employment records issued by Fair Work inspectors.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A Court Order made in August to back-pay the two workers in full was not complied with.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Judge Heather Riley said Cardamone had been the subject of a “litany of complaints” relating to underpayments and the Fair Work Ombudsman had previously made him aware “that his conduct was unlawful”.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “However, he continued to engage in it,” Judge Riley said. “Consequently, the court can only conclude that the breaches were deliberate.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Judge Riley also noted that Cardamone had been involved with five failed companies with combined deficiencies of over $26 million.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 2011, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) disqualified him from managing a corporation for five years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court’s decision sends a clear message to employers that deliberately underpaying workers and ignoring warnings to comply with workplace laws is extremely serious conduct.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We have received more than 30 underpayment allegations from employees of businesses operated by Mr Cardamone since 2013, and he must now pay a financial penalty for his unlawful and unacceptable conduct.”
