      At least 200 businesses in and around
      <strong>
       Mount Gambier
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Renmark
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Murray Bridge
      </strong>
      are being audited as part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s latest education and compliance campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors are checking wage and time records of a cross-section of businesses across the South Australia South East region, including those in the retail trade and accommodation and food services sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said that with a large number of employees engaged in low-skilled work and a tightening of labour market conditions, workers in the region may experience particular vulnerabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Furthermore, the South Australia South East region has one of the highest rates of disputes lodged by visa holders nationally," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We know that overseas workers can be vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace due to factors including a lack of awareness about workplace rights and language barriers.
     </p>
     <p>
      "My agency is undertaking this education and compliance campaign to reinforce to businesses in the region the importance of understanding and complying with their workplace obligations."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said that over the two financial years from 2014-15 to 2015-16, her agency had recovered more than $320,000 in back-pay for 179 workers in the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local employer groups, unions and councils have been notified of the campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors will provide advice and assistance to non-compliant employers found to have minor issues caused by genuine mistakes.
     </p>
     <p>
      By educating businesses about their obligations and assisting them to improve their processes, the Fair Work Ombudsman aims to build a culture of compliance in Australian workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      However Ms James emphasised that any examples of serious non-compliance may lead to enforcement action, including litigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Where businesses refuse to cooperate with my agency, or where our inspectors identify instances of serious or deliberate non-compliance, we will ensure that appropriate action is taken to enforce the law," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Employers must be aware that deliberately flouting workplace laws can result in significant consequences."
     </p>
