     <p>
      More than three-quarters of Townsville businesses are complying with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations under federal workplace laws, random checks by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors made face-to-face visits to 166 local employers as part of the Agency’s ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of maintaining proper employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman continues to see employers failing to keep adequate records and issuing pay-slips that do not contain the required information.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inadequate records hamper the ability of Fair Work inspectors to determine if employees are being paid correctly if a dispute arises over wages. In the past, the Agency has taken legal action against some employers who did not keep adequate records and who were suspected of underpaying their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman liaised with the Townsville Chamber of Commerce before commencing site visits in November last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auditing has now concluded and the results of the campaign were released in Townsville today by Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eighty-eight per cent of employers (146) were found to be compliant with their pay-slip obligations and 86 per cent (142) were meeting their record-keeping responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the issues identified related to employers failing to keep records for all hours worked by their employees or failing to issue employees with sufficiently-detailed pay- slips within one working day of pay day.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ten per cent of employers (17) had not been providing a copy of the Fair Work Information Statement to new employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James welcomed the high compliance rates, but stressed the importance of businesses paying greater attention to their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors spoke to Townsville employers about the free resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au to assist them to understand and comply with their responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Online resources include templates for time-and-wages records and pay slips, fact sheets and tools for determining correct rates of pay for employees, such as PayCheck Plus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it was particularly pleasing to see that Townsville employers who had made mistakes promptly rectify their errors and put processes in place to ensure future compliance.
     </p>
     Any employer or employee seeking advice can also call the Fair Work Infoline on

     . Small Business owners calling the Infoline can opt to be put through to the Small Business Helpline to receive priority service.
