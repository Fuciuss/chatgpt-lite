      <strong>
       18 July 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of a caravan park in
      <strong>
       Far North Queensland
      </strong>
      have been placed on notice after the Fair Work Ombudsman found it was underpaying dozens of workers that it was supplying to work on local farms.
     </p>
     <p>
      The park has received a formal Letter of Caution after investigations revealed that it had underpaid 84 workers almost $30,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the part-time workers were backpackers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated the matter after 10 employees contacted the Agency requesting assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors found that while they were being paid the correct minimum hourly rate of $17.29 for normal work, they were not receiving the $25.94 they should have received for overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments occurred over 11 months last year. The largest amount owing to an individual employee was $1140.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors also found the employer had breached the
      <em>
       Fair Work Act
      </em>
      by cashing out annual leave with each pay, impacting on the workers’ rights to be able to take leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      The caravan park operators are now on notice that further contraventions of federal workplace laws could result in enforcement action, including legal proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a number of Inquiries underway to identify and address the structural and behavioural drivers of non-compliance in various industry networks and supply chains in which overseas workers are heavily represented.
     </p>
     <p>
      These include a review of the wages and conditions of workers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa and a Harvest Trail inquiry into the horticulture and viticulture sectors nationally.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman recently released information about the work it conducted in calendar year 2015 involving visa-holders. Read the media release:

      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is now receiving more complaints from overseas visa-holders working in Australia than ever before.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Visa-holders can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or are reluctant to seek help, so we place a high priority on taking action to ensure their rights are protected,” she said.
