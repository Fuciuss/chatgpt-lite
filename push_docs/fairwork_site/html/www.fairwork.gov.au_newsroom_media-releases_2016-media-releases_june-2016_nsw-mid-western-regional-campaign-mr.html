      The Fair Work Ombudsman is auditing up to 250 businesses across the Mid-Western and Northern regions of NSW as part of a new campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign is focusing on small businesses located in and around
      <strong>
       Dubbo
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Moree
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Narrabri
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Wellington
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Narromine
      </strong>
      and will run until August.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign earmarked the areas for audit because they have been a persistent source of requests for assistance from workers to the Fair Work Ombudsman in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will conduct random checks to ensure employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, overtime and penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
      <br/>
      Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be audited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the campaign will help businesses develop good compliance habits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accommodation and cafes and restaurants are under scrutiny in Dubbo, along with cotton growing, building, industrial cleaning services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural and fishing support services will be scrutinised in Moree and Narrabri.
     </p>
     <p>
      The road freight transport industry in all three towns is also being examined.
     </p>
     <p>
      Key local employer groups and unions have been enlisted to assist the Agency promote the campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the campaign aims to promote awareness among employers of their workplace responsibilities and demonstrate the various ways the Agency can held them to access, understand and apply information to strengthen their compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Inspectors can offer employers tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at
      <strong>

      </strong>
      .
