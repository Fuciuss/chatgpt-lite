     <p>
      An unexpected emergency is an unforeseen or sudden and urgent event or situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether an employee can take carer’s leave because of an unexpected emergency depends on the circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unexpected emergencies aren’t limited to illnesses or injuries and can include taking time to pick up a child from school. Things to consider might include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       how much notice, if any, the employee had of the emergency
      </li>
      <li>
       whether the employee can work from home or use other alternative work arrangements (such as changing their pattern of work to help manage their work and caring responsibilities)
      </li>
      <li>
       the age and independence of the family member or household member who needs care
      </li>
      <li>
       whether the employee can make alternative arrangements to care for the family or household member.
