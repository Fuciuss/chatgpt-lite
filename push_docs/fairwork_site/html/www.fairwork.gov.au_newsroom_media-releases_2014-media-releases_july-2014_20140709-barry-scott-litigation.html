      <strong>
       9 July 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against the former operators of two food retail outlets in Albury, regional NSW.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing court is Barry Scott Distributors Pty Ltd, which formerly operated the Thurgoona Takeaway fish and chip shop and The Rim and Wheel Diner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing court action is the company’s sole director and owner, Ian Andrews.
     </p>
     <p>
      Documents lodged with the Federal Circuit Court allege Mr Andrews and his company have breached workplace laws by failing to reimburse three employees found to have been underpaid more than $17,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the Agency’s second litigation against Barry Scott Distributors and Mr Andrews.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced court action alleging three other employees at Thurgoona Takeaway were underpaid more than $60,000 in 2011-2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the latest proceedings, the Fair Work Ombudsman claims another cook employed at Thurgoona Takeaway was short-changed $12,970 between 2011 and 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also alleges that two cooks employed at The Rim and Wheel Diner were underpaid a total of $4490 last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the Rim and Wheel staff was allegedly paid nothing for two weeks’ work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither business is now trading.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the alleged underpayments after receiving requests for assistance from the former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman issued three formal Compliance Notices in January this year requiring the underpayments to be rectified in full within 21 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite numerous undertakings given by Mr Andrews that this would happen, only $400 was paid to one employee, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      By law, employers must comply with a Compliance Notice issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they seek to challenge it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has previously commenced legal proceedings against a number of businesses which have failed to respond to its Compliance Notices.
     </p>
     <p>
      “In this case, inspectors made extensive efforts to try to resolve the matter by agreement, but were not able to secure sufficient co-operation,” Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency is seeking Court Orders for Barry Scott Distributors to pay the employees all entitlements allegedly owed, plus interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also wants Court Orders requiring Mr Andrews to undertake formal training on employer obligations under the Fair Work Act and to provide written, public apologies to his former staff. A directions hearing is scheduled for September 10 in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors identify underpayments at thousands of businesses nationally each year and resolve the vast majority by working co-operatively with employers, guiding them through the back-payment process and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they pay their staff correctly in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work inspectors will consider enforcement action, including issuing formal Compliance Notices, which lawfully require employers to take prompt action.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is important for employers to understand that when a Compliance Notice is issued, the Fair Work Ombudsman is simply seeking to recover wages that should have been paid in the first instance - we are not seeking to be punitive,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Compliance Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Enforcing Compliance Notices is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of Australia’s workplace laws,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Fair Work inspectors are increasingly issuing Compliance Notices in cases where employers with contravention issues refuse to co-operate and we will consider follow-up action if they are ignored.”
