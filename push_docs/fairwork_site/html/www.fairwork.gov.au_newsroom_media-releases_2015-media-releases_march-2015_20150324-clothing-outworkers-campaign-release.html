      Vulnerable migrant and overseas workers who make clothes from their homes are the focus of a new two-year education and compliance campaign by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulator will write to 1000 clothing retailers, wholesalers, distributors and contractors over the coming weeks to raise awareness about their obligations to clothing outworkers under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The businesses will be provided with information packs containing facts sheets and templates on topics such as the modern awards that apply to their industry, working with clothing outworkers, keeping employment records and issuing pay slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will make face-to-face visits to a number of businesses in attempt to gain insights into issues within the industry and barriers to non-compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information will also be provided to local councils, migrant resource centres, ethnic support groups and other relevant community organisations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of employer groups and unions have also agreed to assist in promoting the Fair Work Ombudsman’s campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign will include radio and newspaper advertising and social media activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information has also been translated in Chinese and Vietnamese at

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the campaign, a number of businesses will be audited later this year.
     </p>

      “We are conscious that overseas and migrant workers can be vulnerable because they are often not fully aware of their rights and reluctant to complain, so it’s important we are proactive about ensuring they are receiving their full entitlements,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure an even playing field for all businesses.
