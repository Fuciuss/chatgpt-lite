      <strong>
       28 April 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eight on-the-spot fines of up to $550 have been issued to massage and nail salons in
      <strong>
       Darwin
      </strong>
      for breaches of federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five Letters of Caution have also been sent to business operators warning them to improve their workplace practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      And four employers have been required to back-pay more than $18,000 in underpaid wages and entitlements to 22 of their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The enforcement action is the result of random audits of 10 massage shops and eight nail salons by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says the level of non-compliance is disappointing and he has flagged ongoing spot checks to monitor the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Massage shops and nail centres were targeted following information provided to Fair Work inspectors about potential contraventions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Observations about some massage parlours have been passed on to the NT police.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says massage shop employees were being short-changed because they were paid per massage instead of the minimum hourly rate they were legally entitled to.
     </p>
     <p>
      “One employee was underpaid more than $3800,” he revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Two of those found to have been short-changed were overseas backpackers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Only one of the 10 massage shops audited was paying its employees the lawful minimum hourly rate.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell says inspectors warned the other nine employers that their per-massage pay arrangements had the potential to result in ongoing underpayment of staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      He says record-keeping practices at some businesses were also poor.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Two businesses failed to keep any employment records at all, making it difficult for us to assess compliance," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Some were also neglecting to provide sufficiently-detailed payslips to their employees.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell reminded Darwin businesses of the legal requirement for them to maintain records of staff, hours worked and to provide payslips within one day of pay day.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said those employers who received Letters of Caution were now on notice that further workplace breaches would likely result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman last year distributed education packs to employers selected for auditing to enable them to review their workplace practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The packs included a copy of the Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2010 for massage businesses and the Hair and Beauty Industry Award 2010 for nail salons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pay guides and fact sheets on record-keeping and pay slips were also distributed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell said it was disappointing that employers had failed to seek assistance to rectify any issues and waited for site-visits to be told of their non-compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, he welcomed the response of those who had underpaid their staff in working with inspectors to correct the errors and reimburse their employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Given our findings, these businesses will stay on our radar for the time being,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We’ll be conducting further random audits in the near future to ensure employers have heeded our advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      “If we continue to detect deliberate or repeat contraventions, or if employers are not willing to co-operate, then we will consider appropriate action, including litigation.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The maximum penalty for a breach of federal workplace law is $51,000 for a company or $10,200 for an individual.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman puts about 50 matters a year before the Courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information to assist both employers and employees can be accessed free 24/7 on the Fair Work Ombudsman website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman can assist employers with accurate, reliable information that is easy to access, understand and apply.
     </p>
     <p>
