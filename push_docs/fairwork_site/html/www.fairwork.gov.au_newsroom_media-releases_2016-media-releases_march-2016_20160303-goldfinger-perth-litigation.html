      <strong>
       3 March 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Young overseas workers on 417 visas were underpaid thousands of dollars for cleaning rooms at a popular
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      hotel, the Fair Work Ombudsman alleges.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against Perth man Blagojce Djoneski and his WA-based contract cleaning company Goldfinger Facility Management Pty Ltd in relation to the alleged underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      After securing a cleaning contract with The Melbourne Hotel in the
      <strong>
       Perth CBD
      </strong>
      , Mr Djoneski employed four overseas workers - three from South Korea and one from the UK - and supplied them to work as cleaners at the hotel.
     </p>
     <p>
      The four workers, including three aged under 25, were in Australia on 417 working holiday visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged these overseas workers each performed between two and four weeks' work at The Melbourne Hotel between April and June, 2014, but were paid nothing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overseas workers were allegedly entitled to be paid a total of $9359, with individual underpayments ranging from $1263 to $3351.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged Mr Djoneski's business underpaid a fifth overseas worker - an Indian national employed as a marketing specialist on a 457 visa - by failing to pay him more than $4000 he was entitled to for 18 weeks' work.
     </p>
     <p>
      A manager at Mr Djoneski's business, an Australian citizen, was allegedly also short-changed more than $13,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      In total, six employees of Mr Djoneski's business were allegedly underpaid $26,627.
     </p>
     <p>
      Breaches of frequency-of-pay and pay-slip laws are also alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated the matter after receiving requests for assistance from employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made repeated efforts to try to resolve the matter before taking court action, but were unable to secure any co-operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Djoneski faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and his company faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for Goldfinger Facility Management to back-pay the workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Perth on April 4.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest penalty awarded nationally by the Courts in a matter initiated by the Fair Work Ombudsman is $343,860 - delivered against a Perth cleaning company and its manager in September, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      In that case, the Court found they had deliberately underpaid six cleaners - including five overseas workers from
      <strong>
       Taiwan
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Hong Kong
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       New Zealand
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Ireland -
      </strong>
      and as well as the penalty, instructed that the employees be reimbursed more than $22,000 in underpaid wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is currently conducting a national review of the wages and conditions of overseas workers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is now receiving more complaints from overseas visa-holders working in Australia than ever before.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last financial year, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered $1.6 million in underpaid wages and entitlements for visa-holders, up from $1.1 million the previous year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman established an Overseas Workers' Team in 2012 in recognition that overseas workers can be vulnerable to exploitation and require specialist assistance.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "While we have always had a strong focus in relation to visa-holders, we now give these vulnerable employees priority through our Overseas Workers' Team - and have invested significant resources to assisting them," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information to assist people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds has been translated into 27 languages and can be accessed at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has fact sheets tailored to overseas workers and international students on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency has also produced videos in 14 languages and posted them on YouTube to assist overseas workers to understand their workplace rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman can assist employers and employees with accurate, reliable information that is easy to access, understand and apply.
     </p>
