      A textile manufacturer in
      <strong>
       Tasmania
      </strong>
      will face court for allegedly trying to avoid termination pay-outs to six of its employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were allegedly short-changed tens of thousands of dollars when their employer placed them on extended stand-down without wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in a bid to have the employees fully reimbursed.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also seeking penalties against the company, James Nelson Pty Ltd and its sole director and part owner Wendy Langridge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matter will be heard in the Federal Circuit Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      James Nelson Pty Ltd operates a weaving mill in
      <strong>
       Launceston
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Six mill staff were allegedly told in June, 2013 that they would be stood down for two-and-a-half months without pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      About a week before they were due to return, they were allegedly advised that the unpaid stand-down would be extended to four months.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to documents filed with the Court, the practice of informing workers shortly before return-to-work dates was again allegedly used to stretch the employees’ unpaid stand-down to five months, then six months, then seven months and longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors investigated after receiving complaints from the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman subsequently told Ms Langridge and her company that it was not lawful to stand-down employees without pay because there was not enough work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency advised that the company had made its employees redundant and was lawfully obliged to pay them redundancy pay, accrued leave entitlements and payment in lieu of notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees, aged between 21 and 69, included three weavers, a storeman/forklift driver, a beamer and a plant engineer.
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of $43,056 is allegedly owing to the employees, with entitlements to individual workers ranging from $5506 to $11,101.
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">
      <span style="text-align: left;">
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made repeated efforts to engage with Ms Langridge and the company to try to resolve the matter by agreement before commencing legal action - but were not able to secure sufficient co-operation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it is crucially important that employers take the time to understand their obligations in relation to termination entitlements and promptly pay employees their entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Losing paid work is a major life event and termination entitlements such as severance pay play a vitally important role in helping to support people while they make plans to re-enter the workforce,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Langridge faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per breach and James Nelson Pty Ltd faces maximum penalties of up to $51,000 per breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for James Nelson Pty Ltd to back-pay the workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman has a particular focus on assisting small businesses to understand and meet their obligations to employees.
