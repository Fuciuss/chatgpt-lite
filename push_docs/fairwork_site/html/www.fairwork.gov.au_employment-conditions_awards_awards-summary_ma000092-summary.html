      Who the Alpine Resorts Award covers
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Alpine Resorts Award covers employers who operate a resort that has an alpine lift. It doesn't matter if the employer runs the lift or not.
     </p>
     <p>
      The award covers employees who work at (or in direct connection with) an alpine resort if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       their employer runs the resort
      </li>
      <li>
       there's a classification covering their work.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Before 1 December 2019, the resort needed to run the alpine lift themselves for the Alpine Resort Award to cover the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Examples of employees and employers covered by the Alpine Resorts Award includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       hospitality workers
      </li>
      <li>
       guest and administrative services
      </li>
      <li>
       cleaners
      </li>
      <li>
       lift operators
      </li>
      <li>
       child care workers
      </li>
      <li>
       ski and snowsport instructors
      </li>
      <li>
       hair and beauty workers.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Alpine Resorts Award also covers labour hire businesses and their employees who are placed with an organisation in the alpine resort industry.
