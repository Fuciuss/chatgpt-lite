      What is an award classification?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Award classifications (also known as levels or grades) are descriptions of roles and types of work. They’re usually found towards the end of an award, often in Schedule A.
     </p>
     <p>
      Classification descriptions include information about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the types of duties an employee may be expected to perform
      </li>
      <li>
       whether the employee supervises other employees
      </li>
      <li>
       the level of experience or qualifications an employee needs to work at that level.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employee’s pay rate is determined by their classification. Employers need to make sure they’ve correctly identified each employee’s classification.
     </p>
     <h2>
      <a id="award-classifications-and-pay-rates">
      </a>
      Award classifications and pay rates
     </h2>
     <p>
      To work out an employee’s pay, you will need to know the:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       award that covers the employee
      </li>
      <li>
       classification level.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Classifications can change if an employee’s role changes. For example, an employee is likely to change classification if they take on more responsibility. Employers should review their award’s classifications when an employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       changes duties, such as becoming a supervisor
      </li>
      <li>
       completes relevant training
      </li>
      <li>
       obtains a new qualification.
      </li>
     </ul>

      How to work out which award covers the employee
     </h2>
     <p>
      To work out if an award covers an employee, you should read the coverage clause (usually clause 4) in the award.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’re not sure which award covers the employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>

       </a>
       .
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Awards cover employers and employees depending on the industry they work in or the type of work an employee performs. You can’t rely on the award title to determine if the award covers the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before deciding which award covers the employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       carefully read the coverage clause and check if there are any exclusions to who the award covers
      </li>
      <li>
       check the employee’s duties are covered within the classification structure
      </li>
      <li>
       consider whether another award could cover the employee.
      </li>
     </ul>

      Step 1: Check the award’s instructions about classifying employees
     </h3>
     <p>
      Awards may contain an explanation or instructions about how to classify employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee’s classification is determined by the main purpose of the role. In other words:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       what the job primarily involves
      </li>
      <li>
       what the employee is required to do in the role.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers need to make sure that the employee’s tasks, qualifications and level of responsibility align with the main purpose of the role and classification. These are outlined in the award.
     </p>
     <h3>
      <a id="consider-classification-definition">
      </a>
      Step 2: Consider the classification definitions
     </h3>
     <p>
      Awards define each classification. You can usually find classification definitions:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       near the end of the award, often in Schedule A, or
      </li>
      <li>
       in another section, closer to or in the pay rates section.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you can’t find them, look in the award’s table of contents or search ‘classification’ in the award. You can find all awards on our
      <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8c54c8d4-668a-45d1-966c-91301e84a30f" href="/employment-conditions/awards/list-of-awards" title="List of awards">

      </a>
      page.
     </p>
     <p>
      To find the right classification, make sure you read the definitions in full and consider all the factors together. These often include:

     <p>
      Make sure you consider the tasks or duties an employee is expected to do.
     </p>
     <p>
      Classification definitions usually include lists of ‘indicative tasks’ that someone would normally do at each level. The award will say if the employee has to do most, some or any of the tasks on the list to be classified at a particular level.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h5>
       Example: ‘Any tasks’ on the list
      </h5>
      <p>
       Ling works as a waiter at a Thai restaurant. The classifications in the Restaurant Award are for an employee doing ‘any’ of the tasks in the task list. When Ling’s employer considers tasks as one of the factors in Ling’s classification, Ling only needs to be doing one task from the list to be classified at a particular level.

     <h5>
      Job titles
     </h5>
     <p>
      Classification definitions sometimes also include indicative job titles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lists of indicative job titles aren’t exhaustive. This means that they’re not the only jobs an employee could be doing to be classified at a particular level.

       <strong>
        Best practice tip
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When classifying someone under an award, it’s important not to just rely on job titles or job descriptions. They can be misleading. Consider what duties the person actually performs and compare them to the classification definitions in the relevant award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that lists of duties or tasks can be indicative, rather than exhaustive, which means the employee may not need to do everything that is listed. Also, some duties or tasks may not be listed but may be considered reasonable as part of the role.

     <h4>
      <a id="skills-and-competence">
      </a>
      Skills and competence
     </h4>
     <p>
      An employee’s level of competency when performing different tasks is also important in some awards to determine an employee’s classification. Some awards say which areas and levels of proficiency employees need to be able to demonstrate to be classified at a certain level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even if employees are performing the same type of tasks, some employees who are working at a higher level may do work of a higher quality or require less direct supervision.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h5>
       Example: Skills and competence
      </h5>
      <p>
       John works in a restaurant in a large hotel. The hotel is covered by the Hospitality Award.
      </p>
      <p>
       John hasn't worked in hospitality before. When he started at the hotel, he was classified at the Introductory level, the lowest level in the award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simin is John's manager. She's been training him in his duties, and he's learnt them very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       After 3 months, Simin assesses John's competency. She determines that he has the skills to progress to the next level. John's new classification is level 1, and he is working as a Food and beverage attendant grade 1.

      <a id="qualifications-and-training">
      </a>
      Qualifications and training
     </h4>
     <p>
      Some awards will require an employee to hold certain qualifications or training to be classified at a particular level.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h5>
       Example: Qualifications and training

      </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      Some awards also recognise relevant industry experience as an alternative to a qualification when classifying employees at a particular level.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h5>
       Example: Prior industry experience or qualification
      </h5>
      <p>
       Mike’s business makes packaged snacks for cafes. Mike hires a new employee, Elizabeth. She has worked in the industry for many years but doesn’t have any formal qualifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once he has considered all the factors, Mike classifies Elizabeth at Level 5 under the Food and Beverage Manufacturing Award. Under this award, the Level 5 classification requires either a Certificate 3 qualification, recognised industry experience or equivalent prior learning.
      </p>
     </div>

      Qualifications don’t have to be considered if:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       someone isn’t using their qualification (for example, the qualification is not relevant to the job)

     <p>
      Some awards say that an employee moves to a higher classification once they’ve worked in a job or industry for a certain period and they’ve gained relevant experience. Time in the industry can include an employee’s experience with a previous employer in the same industry.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">

       Sakib starts work in a construction company as a labourer. It’s his first job, so he has no previous experience in the industry. When he starts work, he’s classified as a Construction Worker 1 (level a) under the Building and Construction Award. The award says that Sakib will move to the Construction Worker 1 (level b) classification after he’s had 3 months’ experience in the industry.

       Sara is a teacher at a primary school. For the past 2 years, she’s been employed at Level 2 under the Teachers Award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sara won’t be eligible to progress to Level 3 until she completes 3 years of satisfactory teaching service at Level 2, because that’s one of the requirements of the classification.

     <p>
      Some award classifications are structured according to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the amount of supervision needed for the job, or
      </li>
      <li>
       whether the employee supervises other people.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      At higher classifications, employees can work more independently and may supervise others. In some cases, tasks may be similar but are under different classifications based on whether employees do them under direct supervision or independently.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h5>
       Example: Reduced supervision
      </h5>
      <p>
       Layla is a customer contact officer for a manufacturing company. She is covered by the Clerks Award. When Layla started, she was classified as a Level 1 employee. Her manager needed to supervise her closely and give her a lot of direction about what tasks to work on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that Layla has been in the role for a few months, her manager only needs to give her general supervision and instructions. Generally, she is allowed to work independently. She is allowed to use her own judgement when helping customers with some problems and to manage her own time, following the company’s internal processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Layla is working independently and on more complex tasks, she can progress to a Level 2 classification under the Clerks Award.

      Step 3: Compare similar classifications
     </h3>
     <p>
      When you’ve found the right classification, it’s always a good idea to read the classification descriptions of the levels above and below the classification you’ve decided on. This helps you check that you’ve found the right one.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers need to make sure that the employee’s duties match the award classification level and be clear about why they selected it.

     <h3>
      <a id="share-the-information">
      </a>
      Step 4: Share the information
     </h3>
     <p>
      When an employer is sure they’ve selected the right classification, they should tell their employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sharing the information helps an employee understand what’s expected of them at work. It also helps employers and employees to feel confident that the classification and pay rate reflect the work they do.

      </a>
      Working temporarily at a higher classification
     </h2>
     <p>
      Some awards contain provisions that allow an employee to work at a higher classification (also known as higher duties) for a limited amount of time. For example, an employee might do the work of a higher-level employee while that employee is on leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee is temporarily performing higher duties, they may be performing tasks they wouldn’t normally perform or taking on extra responsibility. When this happens, the employee needs to be paid at the higher pay rate provided in the award for the time they work at the higher level.
