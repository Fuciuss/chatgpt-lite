      Minimum pay rates
     </h2>
     <p>
      All employees working in Australia are entitled to a minimum wage. This is the minimum amount an employee needs to be paid for the work that they’re doing. The minimum wage is payable before tax is deducted (known as gross pay).
     </p>
     <p>
      For most employees, minimum wages are set by the award that applies to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Usually, when a workplace has a registered agreement, the award doesn’t apply. However, the minimum pay rate in the registered agreement can’t be less than the minimum pay rate in the award.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no award or agreement covers your job or workplace, you’re entitled to be paid the National Minimum Wage.
