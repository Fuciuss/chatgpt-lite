      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of its Degani Bakery and Café compliance activity that found non-compliance at 15 outlets, including underpayment and record keeping breaches.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FWO’s activity involved auditing 14 Degani outlets in Melbourne and 2 in Rockhampton after receiving a high number of requests for assistance, and found just one outlet to be compliant with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The audits resulted in the FWO recovering a total of $44,165 for 86 underpaid workers and issuing:
     </p>
     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>
       10 formal cautions;
      </li>
      <li>
       8 compliance notices; and
      </li>
      <li>
       5 infringement notices (on-the-spot fines).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said under or non-payment of penalty rates was the most common issue identified by inspectors, as well as underpayment of base rates of pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We uncovered issues with record-keeping at several Degani outlets that hindered our ability to determine exactly how much back-pay the employees were owed. Unfortunately, Degani’s failure to meet basic workplace requirements is common throughout the hospitality industry,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      One in ten disputes resolved by FWO in 2016-17 involved a restaurant, café or takeaway food outlet, and nearly one third of the most serious cases that we take to court involve this sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Recent law changes mean franchisors can now be held liable for workplace breaches by businesses in their networks. This report reinforces the need for industry-wide cultural change and hospitality leaders should work with the FWO to support compliance,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      In February, the FWO
      <a href="/about-us/news-and-media-releases/2018-media-releases/february-2018/20180226-shmap-group-degani-litigation-mr">
       commenced court action
      </a>
      against a Degani outlet in Greensborough for allegedly using false records to conceal more than $12,000 in underpayments to workers. The matter remains before the court with a hearing scheduled for 1 October 2018.
     </p>
     <p>
      In November, the FWO
      <a href="/about-us/news-and-media-releases/2018-media-releases/february-2018/20180201-degani-bentons-eu-release">
       entered into an Enforceable Undertaking
      </a>
      with the operators of a Degani outlet in Mornington, south of Melbourne, who underpaid workers almost $10,000.
