       A labour-hire company has back-paid 13 workers a total of $240,600 after they did not receive their termination entitlements at a mine in Western Australia’s
       <strong>
        Pilbara
       </strong>
       region.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were stood down after less than one year of service because their host employer cancelled its work at the mine.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, the workers, including
      </span>
      <span>
       labourers, riggers, carpenters, diesel fitters and an electrician, did not receive outstanding wages, redundancy, accrued annual leave, location allowances or project incentive payments in accordance with their enterprise agreement.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The labour-hire company and the host organisation had an agreement to transfer the employees between them when the stand-down occurred,
      </span>
      <span>
       but the host organisation breached the agreement,
      </span>
      <span>
       which initiated a dispute as to who was the legal employer on the date of termination.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       After the workers were unsuccessful in determining who was legally responsible for paying their termination entitlements, they approached the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that once the labour-hire company assumed responsibility, it reimbursed all outstanding entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The largest amount back-paid to an individual worker was $22,500.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says while it is pleasing the company corrected the underpayments, she suggested businesses need to ensure they are aware of their lawful workplace obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The labour-hire employer has received
      </span>
      <span>
       a Letter of Caution, placing it on notice that further breaches of workplace laws may result in enforcement action
      </span>
      <span>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the case highlights the importance of employers taking the necessary steps to ensure they understand issues surrounding transfer of business and employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important that employers who are unsure about their obligations seek professional advice or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman for information,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our website can assist employers and workers alike understand and comply with their rights and obligations so there aren’t any issues arising around transfer of employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the mistakes are not repeated.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit
