     <p>
      Employers need to pay employees at least monthly for the work they do. Employees can be paid in a number of different ways including in cash, by cheque and directly into their bank account by electronic funds transfer (EFT).

      Pay slips and record-keeping
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employers need to follow certain rules about giving employees pay slips and keeping pay records.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Pay slips
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees need to be given a pay slip within 1 working day of being paid. Pay slips can be given electronically or in hard copy. Pay slips need to include certain details about an employee’s pay. Penalties apply for providing false or misleading information on a pay slip.

     <h3>
      Record-keeping
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employers have to keep accurate and up-to-date records about their employees. This includes information about an employee’s pay, leave and hours of work. Records also need to be kept about any changes to working arrangements or ending employment.

      Payment summaries
     </h3>
     <p>
      Payment summaries, also known as income statements, need to include payroll information required by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Most businesses are covered by Single Touch Payroll, which impacts the way employers need to report payroll, tax and superannuation information to the ATO.
