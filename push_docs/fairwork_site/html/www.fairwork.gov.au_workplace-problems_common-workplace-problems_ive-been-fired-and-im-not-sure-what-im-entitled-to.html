      Follow our step-by-step guide to see if you’ve been given enough notice and what your entitlements are.

      Often, the best way to make sure you’re getting all your entitlements when your employment ends is to speak with your employer. It’s worth preparing first.

       1. Understand your situation

       Check why your employment is ending. The business may no longer need your job (

       Be calm at the meeting. Discuss your situation with your employer and show them the information you’ve found. Follow up in writing after the meeting.

       Example: Not enough notice
      </h3>
      <p>
       Ahmed is a 35-year-old delivery driver for a large courier company. His employer told him the company was downsizing and they didn’t need as many drivers. His job was being made redundant. Ahmed had been employed for just over 5 years and was given one week’s notice before his last day. He didn’t think that was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahmed checked his award, the Road Transport Award, and the National Employment Standards. For his 5 years of service, Ahmed worked out that his employer should have given him 4 weeks notice plus 10 weeks redundancy pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spoke to his boss, Bill. Ahmed showed Bill what the Road Transport Award said about his entitlements when being made redundant. This included his correct notice period and redundancy pay for his 5 years of service. Bill said he couldn’t keep Ahmed on for the extra 3 weeks of the notice period. The company was selling the delivery van that week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill paid Ahmed for the remaining 3 weeks of the notice period (4 weeks in total) and the 10 weeks redundancy pay.
