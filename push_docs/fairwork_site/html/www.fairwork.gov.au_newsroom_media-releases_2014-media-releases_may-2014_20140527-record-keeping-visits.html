      The Fair Work Ombudsman has issued a reminder to businesses of the importance of maintaining proper employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors continue to see employers failing to keep correct records or issuing pay slips that contain the required information.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a bid to raise awareness of record-keeping obligations, site visits are planned to 350 businesses throughout
      <strong>
       NSW
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Victoria
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Queensland
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Tasmania
      </strong>
      and the
      <strong>
       ACT
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The face-to-face visits are aimed at educating employers about their responsibilities and how the Fair Work Ombudsman can assist them to comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inadequate records hamper the ability of Fair Work inspectors to determine if employees are being paid correctly if a dispute arises over wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the past, the Agency has taken legal action against some employers who did not keep proper records and who were suspected of underpaying their staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2010, an Adelaide trolley collecting company and its director were fined $35,000 by the South Australian Industrial Relations Court and the operators of a Melbourne restaurant were penalised $10,000 in the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      In both cases, the lack of records prohibited the Fair Work Ombudsman from determining whether large numbers of employees, suspected of being significantly underpaid, had received their full lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will ask employers selected for auditing to discuss their record-keeping and payslip practices, and where non-compliance is identified, will receive assistance to achieve compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Centres earmarked for site visits include:
      <strong>
       NSW:
      </strong>
      Bathurst and Lithgow and the Blue Mountains region including Blackheath, Katoomba, Leura and Wentworth Falls;
      <strong>
       ACT:
      </strong>
      Canberra;
      <strong>
       Victoria:
      </strong>
      Port Fairy, Portland and Warrnambool;
      <strong>
       Queensland:
      </strong>
      Sunshine Coast including Caloundra, Maroochydore, Mooloolaba and Noosa and the Wide Bay region including Hervey Bay and Maryborough;
      <strong>
       Tasmania:
      </strong>
      Burnie, Devonport and Ulverstone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will hand out education packs with information about the free tools and resources available from the Fair Work Ombudsman to assist them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Equipping people with the information they need helps to create fair and productive workplaces, as well as ensuring a level playing field for all.”
