      Protections for migrant workers
     </h2>
     <p>
      Migrant workers in Australia have the same entitlements and protections under the Fair Work Act as other employees. This includes for things like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pay and wages
      </li>
      <li>
       protection from discrimination
      </li>
      <li>
       notice of termination and final pay.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Migrant workers continue to have these entitlements and protections regardless of their migration status under the
      <a class="external-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1958A00062">
       Migration Act 1958
      </a>
      . This includes situations under the Migration Act when a migrant worker:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       has breached a condition of their visa
      </li>
      <li>
       doesn’t have work rights, or
      </li>
      <li>
       doesn’t have the right to be in Australia.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      There may still be consequences under the Migration Act for migrant workers who don’t comply with their visa conditions or that Act. A breach of the Migration Act also doesn't affect the validity of an employment contract or a contract for services under the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, there may be situations where a worker on a student visa works over the cap of the hours they’re allowed to work under their visa. The worker is still entitled to receive their full workplace entitlements for all hours worked despite this breach. The worker also has the right to apply to a court or tribunal to recover unpaid wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’re a migrant worker in breach of your visa conditions, you can still ask for our help to receive your minimum entitlements.

       <strong>
        Example: Migrant worker not being paid for time worked
       </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Leon is a kitchen hand in a restaurant. He has a student visa which only allows him to work for 48 hours per fortnight. Over the past month, his boss, Sam, makes him work 60 hours a fortnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Leon checked his pay slips, he realised he was only paid for 48 hours each fortnight, not the 60 hours he worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Leon raised the underpayment with Sam, Sam told Leon that Leon’s visa only allows him to work for 48 hours per fortnight. Sam also said he won’t pay Leon for the other 12 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leon knows that working more than 48 hours each fortnight may be breaching his student visa. But he also knows he is entitled to the entitlements and protections under the Fair Work Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leon decides to contact us (the Fair Work Ombudsman) for information and help on what he can do next.

      Your visa
     </h2>
     <p>
      It's important to know the rules for your visa. Your visa may limit the type of work you can do in Australia. Some visas have rules about how many hours you can work (for example, international students), or what job you can do (for example, a seasonal worker).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs) can give you information about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       which visa to apply for
      </li>
      <li>
       your rights and responsibilities under a visa
      </li>
      <li>
       how to change and cancel your visa
      </li>
      <li>
       how to apply for permanent residency.

      Paying for visa sponsorship
     </h3>
     <p>
      It's illegal for someone to ask for, receive, offer or provide a benefit in return for visa sponsorship or employment that requires visa sponsorship. This is called 'paying for visa sponsorship'. Examples of this include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an employer makes someone pay them money in exchange for sponsoring them on a Temporary Skills Shortage (TSS) visa (subclass 482)
      </li>
      <li>
       an employer makes someone pay back some of their pay each week in exchange for a visa.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If you think your employer is engaging in 'paying for visa sponsorship' activity you can contact the
      <a class="external-link" href="http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/">
       Department of Home Affairs
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <h3>
      Cashback schemes
     </h3>
     <p>
      Cashback schemes are also illegal. A cashback scheme is where an employer unreasonably requires someone to pay them in exchange for a job.
     </p>
     <p>

       Visa protections – the Assurance Protocol
