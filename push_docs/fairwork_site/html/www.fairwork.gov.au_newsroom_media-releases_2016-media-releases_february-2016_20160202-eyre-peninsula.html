      <strong>
       2 February 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of workers at
      <strong>
       Port Lincoln
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Whyalla
      </strong>
      have been short-changed thousands of dollars, recent investigations by the Fair Work Ombudsman have revealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Almost 70 workers at one business in Port Lincoln have been reimbursed a total of $11,350 after their employer inadvertently failed to pass on an increase in Sunday penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest individual underpayment was $355.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors discovered the underpayments when they conducted a random audit of the business as part of a National Compliance Monitoring Campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The oversight resulted in employees being paid incorrectly for nine months.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a separate matter, a hospitality business at
      <strong>
       Whyalla
      </strong>
      was found to have underpaid 13 of its staff almost $8000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The casual employees, working as cooks, kitchen hands, grounds people, cleaners and food and beverage attendants, were short-changed their minimum hourly rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest individual underpayment was $1629.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the two cases highlight the importance of regional employers in South Australia ensuring they understand the wage rates applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Underpayment of hourly rates can result in employees being significantly underpaid if left unchecked for an extended period, which can leave businesses facing big back-payments they weren’t budgeting for,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers should take advantage of the free tools and resources offered by the Fair Work Ombudsman to assist businesses to understand and comply with their lawful obligations.
