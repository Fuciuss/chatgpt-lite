     </p>
     <p>
      In an Australian first, a
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      company will face legal action for ignoring a Fair Work Commission order to compensate a young employee who had been unfairly dismissed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against World Gym Sunshine Pty Ltd, a fitness club based at
      <strong>
       Sunshine
      </strong>
      in Melbourne’s western suburbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also facing the Federal Circuit Court will be the company’s sole director and part-owner, Wayne George Mailing, of
      <strong>
       Brighton
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      In January, the Fair Work Commission ordered World Gym Sunshine to pay $2200 compensation within 14 days to a 24-year-old receptionist it found had been unfairly dismissed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman seeking assistance after the compensation was not paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman issued several notices requesting the company to comply with the Commission’s Orders, but they were ignored.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business to try to resolve the matter, but were not able to secure any co-operation,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says her Agency has an important role to play in enforcing orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Compliance is fundamental for the integrity of the workplace relations system and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      World Gym Sunshine faces a maximum penalty of $51,000 and Mr Mailing faces a maximum penalty of $10,200.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for the company to pay the outstanding compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed for September 19.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since May, 2012, the Fair Work Ombudsman has investigated 10 matters relating to alleged non-compliance with Fair Work Commission Orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven were the result of employee requests for assistance and three as a result of referrals from the Commission.
     </p>
