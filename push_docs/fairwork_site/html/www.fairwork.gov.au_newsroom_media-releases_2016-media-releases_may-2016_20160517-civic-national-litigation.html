      <strong>
       17 May 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former operator of a trolley-collection company at
      <strong>
       Wagga
      </strong>
      , in regional NSW, is facing Court for allegedly providing false records to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Sydney man Said Sabbagh and a company he formerly owned and operated, Civic National Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      They previously provided trolley collection services at three Woolworths supermarkets and a Big W site in Wagga.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman conducted a proactive audit of Civic National in 2014 as part of a national Inquiry aimed at ensuring trolley collectors are paid correctly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Civic National received a Notice to Produce employment documents relating to its employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      In response, Mr Sabbagh allegedly provided records that he knew contained false information relating to a number of employees, including in relation to hours of work and amounts paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, it is alleged that the employment records purported to show that one employee had performed paid work - yet he was overseas for the entire period he was purportedly at work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employment records provided by Mr Sabbagh also allegedly purported to show that tax had been deducted from a number of employees' wages, yet Australian Tax Office records showed that no tax was remitted for these employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence legal action because of the alleged deliberate nature and seriousness of the conduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Sabbagh faces penalties of up to $3400 per contravention of workplace laws, while Civic National Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $17,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is currently finalising a public report on the findings of its Inquiry relating to trolley collectors.
