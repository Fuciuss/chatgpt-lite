      A labour-hire business in Perth has back-paid 19 employees - mostly migrant workers - more than $22,000 and agreed to revamp its workplace practices, following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Fair Work Ombudsman investigation found that Shine-Lead Pty Ltd underpaid the employees after supplying them to work at the Yuan's Fresh Meat poultry and meat processing business, based in the Perth suburb of
      <strong>
       Canning Vale
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The investigation found 19 Shine-Lead employees were underpaid a total of $22,137 over a period of less than four months between July and October last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifteen of the employees were overseas workers from China, Taiwan and Malaysia. Most were in Australia on working holiday visas and student visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after receiving a tip-off and found Shine-Lead had paid employees flat rates of between $18 and $19.50 for all hours worked across a standard Sunday-to-Thursday working week.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, under the
      <em>
       Poultry Processing Award 2010
      </em>
      , the employees were entitled to minimum rates of $18.30 for ordinary weekday hours and $32.03 on Sundays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Public holiday entitlements were also underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inadvertent application of the incorrect Award contributed to some underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Underpayment of individual employees, whose main duties were cutting and packing chicken, ranged from $694 to $1787.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company cooperated with the Fair Work Ombudsman and has entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) aimed at encouraging behavioural change and future compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the EU, the company has back-paid all employees in full and committed to make a $2000 donation to the Employment Law Centre of Western Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company will also commission a professional audit of its compliance with workplace laws this year and rectify any breaches; register with the Fair Work Ombudsman's online My Account portal and ensure its managers complete all educational courses; and develop processes for ensuring future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company is also required to display a workplace notice detailing its contraventions at the Yuan's Fresh Meat business premises.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says cases of underpayments involving overseas workers are treated particularly seriously because they can be vulnerable due to a lack of awareness of their entitlements, language barriers and reluctance to complain.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Labour-hire operators, like all employers, have a legal obligation to pay the correct minimum wage rates, and visa holders are entitled to the same minimum rates as Australian workers," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "All employers have a duty to inform themselves of applicable wage rates, claiming ignorance of applicable minimum rates is not an acceptable excuse."
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s investigation found Yuan’s Fresh Meat was not at fault, as the amounts the business paid to Shine-Lead were adequate to cover the correct Award entitlements.
