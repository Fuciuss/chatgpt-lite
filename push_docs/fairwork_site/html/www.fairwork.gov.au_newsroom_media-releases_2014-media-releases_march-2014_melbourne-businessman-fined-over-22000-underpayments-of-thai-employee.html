      The former operator of a Melbourne electrical manufacturing business has been fined $7854 over the underpayment of an immigrant worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Moussa Ghorbani-Palangi owned and operated
      <strong>
       Bayswater
      </strong>
      -based M.G.P. Electrical before it ceased trading last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne has issued the penalty following legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ghorbani-Palangi admitted he was responsible for a process worker being underpaid a total of $22,473 between 2008 and 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Frank Turner ordered the $7854 penalty be paid to the employee to partially rectify the underpayment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ghorbani-Palangi also gave an undertaking to the Court that he would back-pay the outstanding balance to the underpaid employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The male employee, in his 40s, was in Australia from Thailand on a bridging visa when he started work.
     </p>
     <p>
      He is now an Australian citizen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The man was paid a flat hourly rate of $13, later increased to $18, but still below the minimum to which he was entitled as a casual employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Turner described the underpayment as substantial for a low paid worker and said like-minded employers must be deterred from similar conduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      He commented that Ghorbani-Palangi had failed to ascertain the employee's correct entitlements with sufficient diligence, noting that "ignorance of the law is no excuse" and labelling the conduct "at best negligent".
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the involvement of a vulnerable worker and the employer's failure to voluntarily resolve the issue, despite the efforts of inspectors, were significant factors in the decision to place the matter before the Court.
