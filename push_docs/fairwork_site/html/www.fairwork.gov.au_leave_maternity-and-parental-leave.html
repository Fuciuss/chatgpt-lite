       employee adopts a child under 16 years of age.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employees are entitled to up to 12 months of unpaid parental leave. They can also request up to an additional 12 months of unpaid leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some people may know parental leave as 'maternity leave' or 'paternity leave'. These are examples of types of parental leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      Parental leave includes different entitlements for both parents, such as partner leave and adoption leave.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Pre-adoption leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees who are taking parental leave to care for an adopted child are also entitled to 2 days unpaid pre-adoption leave to attend relevant interviews or examinations.
     </p>
     <p>
      This leave can't be used if an employer tells an employee to take another type of leave. For example, paid annual leave.

      Types of parental leave
     </h2>
     <p>
      All employees in Australia are entitled to unpaid parental leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are different types of unpaid parental leave available depending on whether the employee is pregnant or not.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pregnant employees are entitled to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       special parental leave
      </li>
      <li>
       compassionate leave
      </li>
      <li>
       a safe and no safe job leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employees who aren't pregnant are entitled to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       partner leave
      </li>
      <li>
       compassionate leave
      </li>
      <li>
       adoption leave.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employee parents also have a right to return to their old job when their parental leave has finished.
     </p>

      </a>
      Who is eligible for parental leave
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employees are able to take parental leave if they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       have worked for their employer for at least 12 months:
       <ul>
        <li>
         before the date or expected date of birth if the employee is pregnant
        </li>
        <li>
         before the date of the adoption, or
        </li>
        <li>
         when the leave starts (if the leave is taken after another person cares for the child or takes parental leave)
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       have or will have responsibility for the care of a child.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Casual employees
     </h3>
     <p>
      Casual employees are eligible for unpaid parental leave if they have:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       been working for their employer on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months
      </li>
      <li>
       a reasonable expectation of continuing work with the employer on a regular and systematic basis, had it not been for the birth or adoption of a child.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Having another child
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees who have taken parental leave don't have to work for another 12 months before they can take another period of parental leave with that same employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if they have started work with a new employer, they will need to work with that employer for at least 12 months before they can take parental leave.
