      <strong>
       20 February 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Three Japanese backpackers who worked at a café in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      have been reimbursed a total of $10,500 after the Fair Work Ombudsman found they had been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The three young women took part-time jobs after arriving in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were underpaid their minimum hourly rate and penalty rates, receiving an average of about $14 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      As casual employees, they should have received more than $20 an hour for normal hours, as well as additional penalty rates for late night, weekend and public holiday work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees realised they had been short-changed when they read about Australian wage rates in a student magazine.
     </p>
     <p>
      They then contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors subsequently determined that the underpayments were a genuine mistake on the part of the café owner, also from Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business had no history of non-compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, it has received a Letter of Caution from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The letter puts the employer on notice that compliance with workplace laws is now expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business avoided further enforcement action by fully co-operating with Fair Work inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This is an example of our fair, reasonable and proportionate response to employers who admit their mistakes, fix them immediately and put systems in place to ensure the errors are not repeated in future,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “However, we are conscious that overseas workers can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their workplace rights, and are often reluctant to complain, so we won’t hesitate to take action against those who seek to take advantage of that vulnerability.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a strong focus on ensuring that the workplace rights of overseas workers are upheld.
     </p>
     <p>
      In August, the Agency announced a review into the wages and conditions of overseas workers in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa (see
      <a href="http://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/news-and-media-releases/archived-media-releases/2014-media-releases/august-2014/20140804-working-holiday-entitlements-review">
       media release – Fair Work Ombudsman to review entitlements of overseas visa-holders on working holidays
      </a>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      “We want the experience of an overseas worker in Australia to be a positive one. And we simply aim to ensure that all those who work here are treated with respect and accorded the same rights as local workers,” Ms James said.

      The employees were reimbursed all money owed without the need for further action after Fair Work inspectors contacted the businesses and explained their obligations.

     <p>
      Inspectors also assisted employers to put processes in place to ensure they comply with workplace laws in the future.
