      <strong>
       16 February 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of a Victorian transport company have been penalised a total of $41,600 for underpaying three truck drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties, imposed in the Federal Circuit Court, are the result of an investigation and legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Court has imposed a $34,500 penalty against Openica Logistics Pty Ltd and a further $7100 penalty against its director/secretary, Vladimir Taseki.
     </p>
     <p>
      Openica Logistics operates from
      <strong>
       Dandenong South
      </strong>
      and primarily provides an interstate service for transporting cars, caravans, boats, motor homes and machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Taseki was involved in Openica Logistics underpaying three truck drivers a total of $69,175 between 2010 and 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      The individual underpayments were $45,291, $16,422 and $7461.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees, all aged in their 50s, were underpaid living away from home allowances and two were not paid casual loading.
     </p>
     <p>
      One driver was also not paid for all kilometres driven.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the company failed to make a copy of an employee's records available for inspection and copying upon request, as required under the Fair Work Regulations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors discovered the breaches when they investigated requests for assistance lodged by employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were back-paid in full only after the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Handing down his decision, Judge Grant Riethmuller said the underpayments were significant, particularly in the context of wages for truck drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      "There is no evidence that the respondents took any particular steps to ensure compliance with their obligations under the Award," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is apparent that they were aware that there were Awards.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Given the overall number of employees involved in this business, the importance of compliance with the Award was a significant issue warranting careful attention by the employer."
     </p>
     <p>
      On the non-payment of the living away from home allowance, Judge Riethmuller noted that it had been a feature of the relevant Award since 1963 and was intended to compensate drivers for the cost of being away from home on a regular basis and for extended periods and not being provided with suitable accommodation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The respondents point out that the sleeper cabs in the trucks were assessed by Work Safe as sufficient for fatigue management, although, clearly, requiring the driver to sleep in a cabin is an imposition beyond normal arrangements one would expect for an employee, for example a motel room," Judge Riethmuller said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is clear that the living away from home allowance is intended to compensate a driver for these conditions."
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court’s decision sends a message that businesses can expect to face tough penalties and enforcement measures for serious or repeat contraventions of their workplace obligations, or where they refuse to co-operate with the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      "In cases where there is evidence there has been a deliberate disregard to meet these obligations we can, and will, strongly consider using the enforcement measures available to us."
