      <strong>
       15 October 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority (VRQA) is joining forces with the Fair Work Ombudsman to help improve compliance with federal workplace laws relating to apprentices and trainees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The VRQA has signed a two-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      It follows similar MoUs the Fair Work Ombudsman has signed recently with the Accommodation Association of Australia (AAoA), the Australian Hotels Association (AHA), Restaurant and Catering Association (RCA), and the Australian Security Industry Association Ltd (ASIAL).
     </p>
     <p>
      Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell co-signed the MoU in Melbourne with VRQA Director Lynn Glover.
     </p>
     <p>
      The VRQA was established under Victoria’s
      <em>
       Education and Training Reform Act
      </em>
      and its functions include the registration and regulation of apprenticeships and traineeships.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Campbell welcomed the Authority’s commitment to collaboration and exchange of information, saying it is pleasing to see the two parties work together to promote and achieve workplace compliance for vulnerable employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This Memorandum of Understanding highlights the Authority’s commitment to making compliance with workplace laws a high priority across a sector for which we both have regulatory responsibility,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Representatives of both agencies will meet formally at least twice a year to share information and discuss strategic and operational issues concerning the employment of apprentices and trainees.
     </p>
     <p>
      VRQA Director Lynn Glover said the Authority’s relationship with the Fair Work Ombudsman would help it to perform its regulatory role in ensuring apprentices, trainees and their employers met their training contract obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Glover said the VRQA had a strong working relationship with the Fair Work Ombudsman and it was pleasing to formalise it through the Memorandum of Understanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I look forward to further strengthening the relationship between us,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s website – www.fairwork.gov.au – has information to assist employers as well as tools and resources for those who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
