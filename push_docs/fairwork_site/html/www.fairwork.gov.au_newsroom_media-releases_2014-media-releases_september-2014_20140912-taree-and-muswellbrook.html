      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors will visit Taree and Muswellbrook, in regional NSW, to offer free workplace advice to local employers and employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors will be available to answer questions about pay, conditions and other aspects of workplace laws between 10am and 5pm on:
     </p>
     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>
       Wednesday, 24 September, at the Taree Library, on Victoria Street, and
      </li>
      <li>
       Wednesday, 1 October, at the Muswellbrook Library, on Bridge Street.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employees or employers who would like to discuss their workplace rights or obligations are advised to make an appointment by calling (02) 4979 3576.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will have iPads to demonstrate the tools and resources available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Website tools include PayCheck Plus to help calculate minimum pay rates for employees, an online leave calculator, templates for time-and-wages records, best practice guides and online learning courses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the visits aim to raise awareness of national workplace laws, including the National Employment Standards and modern awards.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A big part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s role is to help build knowledge in the community about workplace laws and to help create fairer workplaces,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Opportunities like this where we can speak to employers and employees and help them to learn about the educative tools on our website are an important way to achieve that.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the next 12 months, Fair Work inspectors will visit a number of regional towns throughout NSW that do not have access to a local Fair Work Ombudsman office.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The aim is to provide employers and employees in regional NSW with the opportunity to ask for advice or raise any concerns about their workplace rights,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees and employers seeking further support should get in touch with the Fair Work Ombudsman via the website, or by calling the Fair Work Infoline on
