      <strong>
       11 August 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      International students and an overseas backpacker on a
      <strong>
       417 working holiday visa
      </strong>
      were paid as little as $15 an hour to work at a restaurant in
      <strong>
       Perth
      </strong>
      , the Fair Work Ombudsman has found.
     </p>
     <p>
      The three females, from Malaysia and Taiwan, worked as kitchen hands and waiting staff at the Malaysian Dining Delights restaurant on Manning Road, at
      <strong>
       Bentley
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      They are among five employees, aged between 22 and 41, who were short-changed almost $4200 between July last year and January this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were being underpaid their minimum hourly rate, overtime, weekend, evening, and public holiday rates and split shift allowances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Individual underpayments ranged from $233 to $2175.
     </p>
     <p>
      Restaurant director Soon Huat Koh told Fair Work inspectors he was unaware of Australia’s minimum pay rates or the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award 2010.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Koh was also failing to issue pay slips, for which he received an $850 on-the-spot fine.
     </p>
     <p>
      Four of the five underpaid employees have now been reimbursed all outstanding entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 417 working holiday visa-holder has returned home and cannot be located. Her wages will be held in trust until she can be found.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that while the Malaysian Dining Delights business has no previous record of non-compliance with workplace laws, it is important that the Agency takes steps to ensure behavioural change.
     </p>
     <p>
      It has requested the business and Mr Koh sign an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) requiring certain actions to ensure future compliance with their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      These include engaging an external accounting professional to undertake an audit of wage practices and reporting back to the Fair Work Ombudsman on systems and processes implemented to ensure compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Koh has also agreed to register with the Online tool My Account and complete all education courses designed for employers in the online learning centre at
      <strong>
       www.fairwork.gov.au
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the company will now issue pay slips to employees within one working day of being paid and display a workplace notice detailing the company’s breaches.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman uses Enforceable Undertakings where it has formed a view that a breach of the law has occurred, but where the employer has acknowledged this and accepted responsibility and agreed to co-operate and fix the problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Many of the initiatives included in EUs help to build a greater understanding of workplace responsibilities, motivate the company to do the right thing and help them avoid the same mistakes again,” Ms James said.
