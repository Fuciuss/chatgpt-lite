       public health orders
      </a>
      can require certain employees to take a PCR test. Employees and employers have to comply with public health orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no public health order requires an employee to take a PCR test, an employer may still be able to require an employee to take a PCR test. This includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       where a term of an enterprise agreement, other registered agreement or employment contract permits it
      </li>
      <li>
       by directing the employee to take a PCR test. Any direction needs to be lawful and reasonable.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers should also consider whether an employee is eligible to access a PCR test, which is determined by state or territory health departments.
     </p>
     <p>
      In many circumstances, where an employer is considering requiring employees to be tested for COVID-19, the most practicable option may be to require employees to undertake rapid antigen testing, not PCR testing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers should also ensure that any process for requiring PCR testing of employees is consistent with all legal requirements, including WHS, privacy and anti-discrimination obligations.

     <p>
      If an employee is required to take a PCR test for COVID-19 by their employer (but it isn’t required under a public health order), they’re generally entitled to get tested on work time and be paid for the time as if they had worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee may not be entitled to be paid for time spent getting a PCR test if it is to comply with a public health order or if they’re getting tested at their own discretion, unless they take paid leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      A full-time or part-time employee may be able to take paid sick leave if they can’t work at the time of taking a PCR test because of a personal illness or injury. The usual rules about giving notice and evidence to their employer apply. Get more information at

       Paid sick and carer’s leave
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      If paid sick leave isn’t available, employees can discuss other arrangements with their employer. These could include:
     </p>

      <li>

       </a>
       .
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employers should consider any award, agreement, employment contract or workplace policy that applies because they could be more generous.
