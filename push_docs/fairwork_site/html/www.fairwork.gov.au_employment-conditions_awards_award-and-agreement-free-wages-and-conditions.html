      To find out if an employee is covered by a registered agreement:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       ask the employer
      </li>
      <li>

       Example: When an employee is award and agreement free
      </h3>
      <p>
       Nerida is employed as senior regional manager of three Lucky Hotels in Melbourne. Thomas is employed as a hotel manager at Lucky Hotel in Carlton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucky Hotel doesn’t have a registered agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hospitality Award covers hospitality employers and their employees who have jobs listed in the classification definitions of the award. The classifications cover some management staff, but not senior managers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas is covered by the Hospitality Award because the duties of his role are covered in the classification definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nerida isn’t covered by the Hospitality Award. Even though it covers managers in the hospitality industry, it doesn’t cover her particular job because it doesn’t cover senior managers. She has checked that her job is not covered by any other award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nerida’s role is, therefore, award and agreement free. Her entitlements come from her employment contract and the Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act), including the NES.
      </p>
     </div>
     <h3>
      Myth: all managers and professionals are award free
     </h3>
     <p>
      Many managers and professionals have not traditionally been covered by awards. This includes accountants and finance, marketing, legal, human resources, public relations and information technology specialists.
     </p>
     <p>
      Check the industry definition and job classifications of each award carefully as some managers and professionals are covered by an award.
     </p>
     <p>
      After checking relevant industry awards you should also check:

     <h3>
      Myth: employees who sign a contract aren’t covered by an award
     </h3>
     <p>
      A contract can’t make employees worse off than their minimum legal entitlements. This means that the entitlements in the award that applies to them, and the entitlements in the NES, keep applying, even if they sign a contract that gives them less.
     </p>
     <div class="highlight blue">
      <h3>
       Example:
      </h3>
      <p>
       If an employee signs a contract that says they get 5 days of sick leave per year, they’re still entitled to 10 days paid personal/carer’s leave (which includes sick leave) from the National Employment Standards, plus any other entitlements they get from their award.

      High income employees

     <p>
      Awards don't apply to high income employees. A high income employee is an employee who:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       has accepted a written
       <a data-href="/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2047" href="/taxonomy/term/420">

        high income threshold
       </a>
       . The high income threshold changes each year. From 1 July 2023, it is $167,500.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A guarantee of annual earnings can be accepted before an employee starts with an employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      To calculate an employee’s earnings to see if they meet the threshold, include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee’s wages
      </li>
      <li>
       the agreed value of non-monetary benefits.

      When calculating an employee’s earnings to see if they meet the threshold don’t include:

       payments which can’t be calculated in advance such as:
       <ul>

     <h3>
      Agreed ordinary hours of work
     </h3>
     <p>
      The ordinary hours of work for an award and agreement free employee are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       no more than an average of 38 hours per week
      </li>

     <ul>
      <li>
       38 hours
      </li>
      <li>
       the employee’s usual weekly hours of work.

     </ul>
     <h3>
      When there are no agreed ordinary hours of work

     <p>
      If there is no agreement, the ordinary weekly hours are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       full-time employees – 38 hours
      </li>
      <li>
       all other employees – their usual weekly hours of work or 38 hours (whichever is less).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If an employee doesn’t have usual weekly hours and isn’t a full-time employee work out their ordinary weekly hours by:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       adding up the total hours the employee has worked in the past 4 weeks
      </li>
      <li>
       dividing by 4.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the employee has worked for less than 4 weeks:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       add up the total hours the employee has worked
      </li>
      <li>
       divide by the number of completed weeks.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An averaging of hours arrangement means that the actual hours worked each week can be different and can include additional hours, provided the additional hours are reasonable.

       Example: Averaging of hours over 4 weeks
      </h3>
      <p class="TableHeading">
       Mai agrees with her employer to work an average of 20 ordinary hours each week over a period of 4 weeks.
      </p>

       She actually works:

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       15 + 25 + 10 + 30 / 4 weeks = 20 hours per week on average.

     <p>
      An averaging of hours arrangement must:

      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
       all other employees – their usual weekly hours of work or 38 hours (whichever is less).

     </ul>
     <h3>
      When overtime applies
     </h3>
     <p>
      Award and agreement free employees don’t get a higher pay rate when they work overtime hours, unless their employment contract says so.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Meal and rest breaks
     </h3>
     <p>
      Award and agreement free employees don’t have any set meal and rest breaks. Meal and rest breaks may be provided for in:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       an employment contract
      </li>
      <li>
       workplace health and safety legislation.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Workplace health and safety legislation generally says that an employer must provide a safe work environment for employees. This may include giving employees meal and rest breaks.

     <h3>
      Annual leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      Full-time and part-time award and agreement free employees get 4 weeks annual leave each year.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Annual leave for shiftworkers
     </h3>
     <p>
      Shiftworkers (other than casuals) get 5 weeks of paid annual leave each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      An award and agreement free employee is a shiftworker if the employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       is employed in a business where shifts are continuously rostered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
      </li>
      <li>
       is regularly rostered to work those shifts
      </li>
      <li>
       regularly works on Sundays and public holidays.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Taking annual leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employer and an award and agreement free employee may agree on when and how paid annual leave may be taken by the employee. They can agree, for example, that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       it may be taken before it has been accrued
      </li>
      <li>
       it must be taken within a fixed period of time after it is accrued
      </li>
      <li>
       a certain period of notice must be given before taking leave
      </li>
      <li>
       extra time on leave can be taken for the same overall pay, for example, 4 weeks leave at half-pay instead of 2 weeks leave at full pay.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Often these agreements are set out in company policies or an employment contract.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Direction to take annual leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      An employer can require an award and agreement free employee to take paid annual leave if the requirement is reasonable. Examples when it may be reasonable include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       the employee’s leave balance is excessive
      </li>
      <li>
       the employer’s business is being shut down temporarily (for example, between Christmas and New Year).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Cashing out annual leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      An award and agreement free employee can make an agreement with their employer to get an extra payment instead of taking leave (called ‘cashing out’) if the:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       agreement is in writing
      </li>
      <li>
       employer pays the employee the same amount the employee would get if they had taken the leave
      </li>
      <li>
       employee has at least 4 weeks left in their leave balance after the rest is cashed out.
