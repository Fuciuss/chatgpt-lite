      The operator of a cleaning business in regional South Australia is facing the Federal Circuit Court for allegedly underpaying eight employees more than $7000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against Sharna Harvey, who operates ‘Shan’s Cleaning Services’ at
      <strong>
       Whyalla
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Harvey allegedly breached workplace laws by failing to respond to a Compliance Notice to back-pay eight employees $7673 in outstanding wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were allegedly underpaid for cleaning work at residential and commercial properties between January and April, 2015. One worker also performed clerical duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five of the workers were allegedly paid nothing at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      In July, 2015, the Fair Work Ombudsman served Ms Harvey with a Compliance Notice requiring her to rectify the alleged underpayments within 19 days, but it was ignored.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must adhere to Compliance Notices or make a Court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record-keeping and pay-slip laws were allegedly also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors made efforts to resolve the matter by agreement, but had not received sufficient co-operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We prefer to assist employers to rectify inadvertent non-compliance issues, but we are prepared to take legal action against employers who refuse to co-operate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Harvey faces maximum penalties of up to $5100 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order for Ms Harvey to pay the employees the amounts that are allegedly owed, plus interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Adelaide on February 3.
