      hair and beauty business is facing Court for allegedly ignoring a Fair Work Commission order to compensate an employee who had been unfairly dismissed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against Maria Raimondi and her company Raimondi Investments Pty Ltd, operators of the Raimondi Hair and Day Spa at
      <strong>
       Eltham
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      In June, the Fair Work Commission ordered Ms Raimondi’s company to pay $6050 compensation to a hairdresser it found had been unfairly dismissed earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after receiving a referral from the Fair Work Commission that the compensation was not paid within the required 14 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman made several requests for the company to comply with the Commission’s Orders, but the company did not pay the compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors made extensive efforts to engage with this business to try to resolve the matter, but were not able to secure co-operation,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation was paid only after the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action late last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says her Agency has an important role to play in enforcing orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Compliance is fundamental for the integrity of the workplace relations system and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Raimondi Investments faces a maximum penalty of $51,000 and Ms Raimondi faces a maximum penalty of $10,200.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne for December 11.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since May, 2012, the Fair Work Ombudsman has investigated 12 matters relating to alleged non-compliance with Fair Work Commission Orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eight were the result of employee requests for assistance and four as a result of referrals from the Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The action against Ms Raimondi and her company is only the second Fair Work Ombudsman litigation alleging breach of a Fair Work Commission Order to pay unfair dismissal compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the earlier case, Melbourne company World Gym Sunshine Pty Ltd and its director Wayne George Mailing were fined almost $50,000 for ignoring an order to pay $2200 compensation to a young employee (see:
