      after re-auditing 479 businesses that had previously breached workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign targeted businesses in various sectors across Australia, with a particular focus on industries employing vulnerable workers – including hospitality, retail, construction and manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors found that 62 per cent of employers they re-audited are now meeting their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where inspectors identified non-compliance, they recovered $244,246 for 347 workers, issued 16 compliance notices, 56 infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) and 88 formal cautions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two Adelaide nail salons were taken to court for serious breaches found in the audits. Earlier this year, the Court handed down $130,000 in penalties against

      and a $10,560 penalty against the former owner of

      .

      In addition, Melbourne fast food business Xin Long Pty Ltd entered into an

      following underpayments and record-keeping breaches.

      released today outlines the activities undertaken by Chemist Warehouse under the partnership to promote workplace compliance across its network.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said the results reflected the effectiveness of the agency’s compliance and education activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Once we have identified employers who are breaching the law, we assist them to rectify the situation, educate them about their workplace obligations and provide them with the tools to manage their employees’ pay and entitlements.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “We regularly follow up with businesses to ensure they have made the necessary changes to comply with workplace laws. This activity confirms that most employers respond well to initial contact, and we are having a significant impact on long-term behavioural change,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Any employer found in breach of workplace laws should be aware that we will continue to monitor their compliance and take appropriate action until they meet legal obligations to their employees,” Ms Parker said.
