      <strong>
       14 August 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former owner-operator of a
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      pizza outlet has been fined for refusing to reimburse eight employees who were underpaid almost $26,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court has imposed a penalty of $3825 against Sotirios Theocharidis, who formerly owned and ran the Crust Gourmet Pizza outlet at
      <strong>
       Maroubra
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Eight delivery drivers and sales employees who worked for Theocharidis, including five aged under 25, were short-changed a total of $25,995 in 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Nick Nicholls requested the penalty be paid to the workers to partially rectify the underpayments, which remain outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the underpayments when it audited the business as part of a proactive campaign focused on the fast food sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2013, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a Compliance Notice to Theocharidis and his private company that required the underpayments to be rectified - but they failed to meet the requirements of the Notice and no application for a review of the Notice was made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work Inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Nicholls found that Theocharidis failed to back-pay the workers despite the Fair Work Ombudsman having earlier put him on notice of the need to comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Nicholls found that Theocharidis’ contravention of workplace laws was deliberate and that he had been unco-operative with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty imposed should “serve as a general deterrent to others in the fast food industry, which is said to be ‘notorious’ for non-compliance with the standards required by the Fair Work Act,” Judge Nicholls said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court’s decision demonstrates that failing to promptly back-pay workers who have been short-changed will not be tolerated and will be punished.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We prefer to assist employers to rectify inadvertent non-compliance issues but we are prepared to take legal action against employers who refuse to co-operate,” she said.
