      The Fair Work Ombudsman and the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs) work together to help you understand your legal rights when working in Australia.

     <p>

      , you continue to have the same entitlements and protections under the Fair Work act as other employees, regardless of your migration status. Your sponsor is required to meet a number of obligations which ensure that you are provided with appropriate terms and conditions of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      These obligations require your employer to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       provide you with equivalent pay to that of any Australian employee who has the same occupation as you in your workplace
      </li>
      <li>
       only require you to perform duties that relate to your approved occupation
      </li>
      <li>
       pay reasonable and necessary travel costs to allow you and your family members to leave Australia, if requested in writing by you, your family or Home Affairs on your behalf
      </li>
      <li>
       not make you pay for any costs relating to your recruitment, or the costs associated with the business becoming or being an approved sponsor, including migration agent costs
      </li>
      <li>
       make sure that you do not work for any other employers without authorisation
      </li>
      <li>
       pay you in a manner that is capable of being verified by an independent person (for example, electronic funds transfer or cheque).

      Your rights under the Fair Work Act
     </h2>
     <p>
      Everyone working in Australia is entitled to basic rights and protections in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is responsible for ensuring employers are meeting the legal requirements of Australian workplace laws, specifically the Fair Work Act (FW Act), including the National Employment Standards (NES).
     </p>
     <h3>
      National Employment Standards
     </h3>
     <p>
      Most people working in Australia are covered by the National Employment Standards. The NES apply to all employees covered by the national workplace relations system regardless of the award, agreement or contract of employment that applies to an employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NES ensure that you have certain minimum conditions of employment. These minimum conditions cannot be reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minimum workplace entitlements under the NES are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a maximum standard working week of 38 hours for full-time employees, plus ‘reasonable’ additional hours
      </li>
      <li>
       a right for certain employees to request flexible working arrangements (such as changes in hours of work) from their employer
      </li>
      <li>
       parental and adoption leave of 12 months (unpaid), with a right to request an additional 12 months
      </li>
      <li>
       4 weeks of paid annual leave each year plus an additional week for certain shiftworkers (pro rata for part-time employees)
      </li>
      <li>
       10 days of paid sick and carer’s leave each year (pro rata for part-time employees), 2 days of paid compassionate leave for each permissible occasion and 2 days of unpaid carer’s leave for each permissible occasion
      </li>
      <li>
       10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave each year
      </li>
      <li>
       community service leave for jury service or activities dealing with certain emergencies or natural disasters. This leave is unpaid, except for jury service which is paid for up to 10 days
      </li>
      <li>
       long service leave
      </li>
      <li>
       a paid day off for public holidays, except where reasonably required to work
      </li>
      <li>
       notice of termination and redundancy pay
      </li>
      <li>
       the right for new employees to receive the Fair Work Information Statement. Casual employees must also be given the Casual Employment Information Statement
      </li>
      <li>
       the right for casual employees to become permanent employees in some circumstances.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Some conditions or limitations may apply to your entitlement to the NES. For instance, there are some exclusions for certain casual employees. For more information on the NES, visit our
      <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bdbf5ee1-1b22-4a6a-9263-4a5b912b9ea9" href="/employment-conditions/national-employment-standards" title="National Employment Standards">

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <h3>
      Modern awards
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the NES your employment may be covered by a modern award. Modern awards provide minimum wages and conditions for an industry or occupation. These conditions apply on top of the NES and include entitlements such as breaks, allowances and rates of pay for working at different times.
     </p>
     <h3>
      General protections
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employees have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination, the right to engage in industrial activities (including the right to become or not become a member of a union) and the right to be free from undue influence or pressure when negotiating individual arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees are also entitled to protection from having or exercising a workplace right which includes being entitled to a benefit under a workplace law or making a complaint to the Fair Work Ombudsman about their employment arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace rights also include the right for employees to talk about (or not talk about) their current or past pay, and the terms and conditions of employment that would be needed to work out their pay (such as hours of work). They can also ask other employees the same thing (about their pay and terms and conditions of employment) but employees can’t be forced to share this information if they don’t want to.
     </p>
     <p>
      For more information about these rights, including when these rights started applying and who they apply to, see

     <h3>
      Pay slips
     </h3>
     <p>
      Employers must issue pay slips to you within one (1) working day of your pay day. It is best practice for these to be written in plain and simple English.
