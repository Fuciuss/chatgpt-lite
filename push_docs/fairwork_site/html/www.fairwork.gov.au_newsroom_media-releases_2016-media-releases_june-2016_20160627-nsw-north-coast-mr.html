      <strong>
       27 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of factory workers on the NSW
      <strong>
       Mid-North Coast
      </strong>
      have now been reimbursed a total of $795,000 after they were underpaid last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer has repaid all outstanding entitlements under a repayment plan agreed to with the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The voluntary back-payment is the largest the Fair Work Ombudsman was able to achieve this financial year without the need for enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 83 workers were employed by W.E. Smith Engineering at
      <strong>
       Boambee
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated the company after receiving requests for assistance from 38 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fabrication, production, management and administration employees, including several apprentices and young workers, were paid irregularly over nine months last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      W.E. Smith told the Fair Work Ombudsman it was hampered by cash flow problems and delayed payments from clients.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business specialises in the design and manufacture of heat exchange equipment for the mining and energy industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      W.E. Smith went into voluntary administration last year and appeared at unsuccessful Fair Work Commission dispute resolution hearings with the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union over unpaid wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman subsequently issued the company with a Compliance Notice in February this year requiring the back-payment of outstanding entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must adhere to the formal Compliance Notice or make a court application for a review if it seeks to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      W.E. Smith agreed to back-pay all workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest amount owed to an individual worker was $26,150.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says ensuring staff are paid their correct wages on time is one of the most fundamental workplace obligations for an employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have, and always will, pursue the employer when we find cases of non-compliance," Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is the employer first and foremost who is responsible for paying the correct entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Employees should not be put in a position where they may struggle to pay their bills because they haven’t been paid the correct wages on time."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says it was encouraging to see W.E. Smith accept assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman and reimburse all money owed.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have a flexible and fair approach when employers are willing to co-operate with us to ensure these issues don’t occur in the future," she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency recovers millions of dollars for thousands of employees across Australia each year through the voluntarily resolution of workplace issues, including unpaid wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last financial year, the Fair Work Ombudsman received more than 25,000 requests for assistance and recovered more than $22.3 million via all methods of resolution for almost 12,000 workers across Australia, including $165,200 for 187 workers in the
      <strong>
       Coffs Harbour-Grafton region
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit the Fair Work Ombudsman website at www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      for advice.
     </p>
     <p>
      An interpreter service is available by calling
      <strong>
       13 14 50
      </strong>
      , and information on the website is translated into 27 languages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tools and resources available on the website include templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
