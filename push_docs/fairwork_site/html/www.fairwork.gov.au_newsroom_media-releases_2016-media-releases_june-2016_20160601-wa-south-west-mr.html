       A company at Manjimup in Western Australia has back-paid an employee $14,200 in termination entitlements following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The former full-time employee sought assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman after unsuccessful attempts at resolving the issue with his employer.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee waited eight weeks in the hope he would receive his payout of 35 hours overtime and 454 hours of annual leave.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       When later questioned by the Fair Work Ombudsman, the employer acknowledged it had limited knowledge of workplace laws and employee entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the business has
      </span>
      <span>
       co-operated with the Agency and voluntarily repaid all outstanding entitlements to its former worker.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the case study highlights the need for regional WA employers to ensure that they are fully aware of their workplace obligations and employee entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We work closely with employers to help them get the basics right in the first place so that problems don’t arise in future,’’ she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Where an issue does arise, we will work with the parties to assist them to resolve the matter, and then put processes in place to ensure the same mistakes are not made again.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “If employers have misunderstood their obligations, we start with information and advice and encourage self-resolution.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “When we find errors, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James encouraged employers who had any uncertainty about whether their workplace practices were appropriate to visit
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
       or call the Infoline
       <strong>
        13 13 94
       </strong>
       for advice. A free interpreter service is available on
       <strong>
        13 14 50
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Small business callers can receive priority service when they call the Infoline via the Small Business Helpline, which has assisted more than 300,000 callers since it was launched in 2013.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Wages, conditions, termination of employment, leave and entitlements are the most common topics small business owners seek assistance with through the Helpline.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Agency also has a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements. Visit
