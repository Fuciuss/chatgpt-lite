       Best practice tip

       The employee should put their resignation notice in writing to the employer. Use our
       <a href="/tools-and-resources/templates/letter-of-resignation">

      What happens after an employee gives notice?
     </h2>
     <p>
      Once an employee gives their employer notice, their employer should make sure the amount of notice is correct.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer doesn't have the choice to accept or reject an employee's resignation. Usually employers will acknowledge an employee's resignation and then the employee works as usual until the end of the notice period, when their employment ends.

     </h2>
     <p>
      If an employer doesn't want an employee to work out the notice period, they should first check the terms of their award, enterprise agreement, other registered agreement or employment contract.

      Taking leave during a notice period

     <p>
      An employee can take paid annual leave during a notice period if their employer agrees to the leave.

     <p>
      Notice can include public holidays but they don't usually extend the notice period.

     <p>
      An employee can take paid sick or carer's leave during a notice period if they give:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       notice of the leave as soon as possible
      </li>
      <li>

      An employee who has used up all their paid sick leave may be able to take unpaid leave. They need to give their employer notice and evidence.
