       The FWO is the Australian Government agency responsible for ensuring compliance with workplace relations laws through advice, education and where necessary enforcement.

      Our setting
     </h2>
     <p>
      <span>
       The FWO works to achieve its purpose in a diverse and changing environment. The FWO engages with employers, employees, their representatives, community organisations and other stakeholders to support compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces. FWO also looks to work across Government, to leverage all of the Government’s programs and laws to build compliance throughout Australia.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The FWO will provide education and assistance to support businesses to meet regulatory requirements and improve
      </span>
      employment practices. The information provided can be complex and the FWO seeks to provide it in a way that can be easily understood and applied. By understanding workplace laws and implementing effective employment practices, businesses will be able to make informed decisions and be better equipped to respond to challenges. This will help businesses focus on being successful, creating jobs and contributing to Australia’s economic and social wellbeing. The FWO will engage purposefully with businesses to reduce the burden and costs associated with regulatory compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Unlawful employment practices impose significant costs on individuals and the community. These behaviours create barriers to workforce participation, weaken the integrity of the workplace relations system, distort the labour market and undermine the principles of fair competition. The FWO will support vulnerable workplace participants to address the barriers to achieving compliance. Our approach to addressing non-compliance will see proportionate and appropriate use of enforcement tools. We will reinforce accountability within business’ supply chains and networks, encouraging them to take responsibility to prevent potential exploitation of vulnerable segments of the workforce, including migrant workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Changes in the external environment have the potential to impact the work of the FWO and may include changes to budget, legislation, industrial instruments and case law. The FWO will respond quickly to changes in the external environment and will provide advice to inquiries or reviews that have the potential to impact our work. The FWO is committed to building the agility of our people and the organisation to ensure we are responsive to emerging developments.

      Our approach

       The FWO will take an innovative approach to achieving maximum impact within our allocated budget by:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        embracing the latest technology and communication practices to deliver self-service resources allowing easy and timely access to information
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        targeting compliance activities where they have the greatest impact and for those who are most vulnerable
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        using data and intelligence to identify, inform the public on and address new and emerging areas of non-compliance
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        engaging with diverse community networks and intermediaries to design and deliver effective compliance advice and services
       </span>

      <li>
       <span>
        developing tailored, accessible and reliable services to meet the needs and demands of the community
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        using all forms of media to engage and inform target audiences about compliance with workplace laws as well as the potential consequences of not complying.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       The FWO has established a Risk Management Framework modelled on the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy that complies with all mandatory elements of the policy.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The FWO promotes a positive approach to risk, placing a priority on managing risks strategically and systematically.  We seek to apply a consistent approach through all levels of the organisation and integrate risk management into our daily activities.

     <p>

       The FWO will prioritise cohorts that evidence tells us need the most help to understand and apply workplace laws.

This includes supporting small business to comply and focussing on vulnerable cohorts, in particular, migrant workers and businesses and young workers. Industries or subsectors with high levels of non-compliance such as hospitality, retail, cleaning, security and trolley collecting will also be prioritised.
