      A
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      printing finishing business and its operator will face the Federal Circuit Court for allegedly failing to satisfy the requirements of a Compliance Notice issued to it by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mega Tabs Services Pty Ltd and Mr Lloyd Lam allegedly failed to back-pay $229,564 to 14 migrant workers, who asked the FWO for assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers, in Australia from Korea on 417 working holiday visas, were allegedly paid a flat hourly rate of $13 to cut, glue and assemble paper and cardboard at the company’s Alexandria premises in inner Sydney between November 2013 and November 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      This allegedly led to underpayments of base rates of pay, casual loading, afternoon and night shift allowances, public holiday penalty rates and overtime rates owed under the
      <em>
       Graphic Arts, Printing and Publishing Award
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, workers were allegedly entitled to combined base rates and casual loading of between $20.63 and $21.69 per hour, and penalty rates of up to $54 per hour. Individual workers were allegedly owed between $4,105 and $36,666.
     </p>
     <p>
      In July last year, Fair Work Inspectors issued a Compliance Notice to the company requiring it to pay $229,564 to the 14 workers by 27 August 2018, which the FWO claims was not complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said Compliance Notices are an important enforcement tool for the regulator.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Under the
      <em>
       <em>
        Fair Work Act
       </em>
      </em>
      , business operators must not fail to comply with Compliance Notices without a reasonable excuse, unless they make a Court application for a review if they seek to challenge a Notice.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “The Fair Work Ombudsman enforces Compliance Notices to assist employees and protect the integrity of the workplace relations system,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We will continue to prioritise any requests for assistance from migrant workers, who can be particularly vulnerable due to language or cultural barriers, or visa status.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman seeks orders for the company and Mr Lam to be liable to pay the $229,564, plus interest. In addition, the company faces a penalty of up to $31,500 and Mr Lam of up to $6,300.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney on 17 June 2019.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has an agreement with the Department of Home Affairs where visa holders can ask for our help without fear of their visa being cancelled.
