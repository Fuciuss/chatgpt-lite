     <p>
      Penalties totalling $90,000 have been imposed against a security contractor in regional Queensland who failed to pay four employees almost $10,000 for work they performed.

      man Douglas Charles Kidd has been fined $15,000 and his
      <strong>
       Airlie Beach
      </strong>
      -based company Mordel Pty Ltd, which trades as Spartan Security Group, has been fined a further $75,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalties, imposed in the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane, are the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mordel has also been ordered to pay four security guards a total of $9704 it failed to pay them for short periods of work they completed in 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the employees is owed $4272 for about three weeks’ work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the employees contacted the Agency for help.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Kidd and his company failed to respond to two Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors requiring two employees to be paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, business operators must adhere to Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work inspectors or make a court application for a review if they are seeking to challenge a Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Record-keeping laws were also breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court’s decision sends a clear message to employers that failing to pay employees for work they perform is serious conduct and will not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Legal actions such as this also assist employers who are doing the right thing by their employees, because it helps them to compete on a level playing field,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said it was of concern that after warning Mr Kidd over the non-payment of wages, the Fair Work Ombudsman had since received further allegations of underpayment from other Mordel employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      These have resulted in Mordel back-paying three employees more than $5000.
