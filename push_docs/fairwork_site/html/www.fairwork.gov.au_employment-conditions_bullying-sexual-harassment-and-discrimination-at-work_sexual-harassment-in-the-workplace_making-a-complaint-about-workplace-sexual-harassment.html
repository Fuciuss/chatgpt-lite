      If you think sexual harassment has happened (or is happening) at your workplace, you can talk to people like:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a supervisor or manager
      </li>
      <li>
       a health and safety representative
      </li>
      <li>
       the human resources department

       a counsellor

      <li>
       a lawyer.

      Unions are organisations that represent employees and can look into suspected breaches of workplace laws. There are unions for many industries, including:

      <li>
       building and construction
      </li>
      <li>

      With the Fair Work Commission
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Commission (the Commission) is the national workplace relations tribunal. They can deal with disputes about sexual harassment in connection with work under the Fair Work Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a person (or group of people) believes they have been sexually harassed in connection with work, they (or an industrial association such as a union) may be able to apply to the Commission to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       make a stop sexual harassment order to prevent future sexual harassment
      </li>
      <li>
       deal with a sexual harassment dispute to remedy past harm, or
      </li>
      <li>
       do both of these things.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Commission can make a stop sexual harassment order if it is satisfied that a person has been sexually harassed and there is a risk they will continue to be sexually harassed in connection with their work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission may also be able to take other steps to deal with a sexual harassment dispute including through:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       conciliation
      </li>
      <li>
       mediation, or
      </li>
      <li>
       by making a recommendation or expressing an opinion.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the dispute can’t be resolved these ways, the Commission may also be able to deal with the dispute by arbitration if the parties’ agree.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Commission deals with the dispute by arbitration, they can make an order:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       for compensation
      </li>
      <li>
       for lost wages
      </li>
      <li>
       requiring a person to do something that’s reasonable to remedy any loss or damage suffered.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The Commission has information and guidance about making applications to stop sexual harassment at work. This includes information about:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       who can apply
      </li>

     <p>
      We (the Fair Work Ombudsman) are the national workplace regulator. We can help with some issues around sexual harassment at work usually when an employee has already sought help, such as via the Commission or another government body. This includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       investigating a workplace for non-compliance with laws prohibiting workplace sexual harassment
      </li>
      <li>
       taking action when someone doesn’t comply with a Commission stop sexual harassment order (see above).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We also have the power to start court proceedings for alleged breaches of laws prohibiting sexual harassment.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you believe you have been sexually harassed in connection with work, you should make an application to the Commission in the first instance. See the information above for how to do this.
