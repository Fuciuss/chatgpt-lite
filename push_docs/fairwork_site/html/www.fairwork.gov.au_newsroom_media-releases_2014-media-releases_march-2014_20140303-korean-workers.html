      The Fair Work Ombudsman is encouraging employees in Australia’s Korean community to learn more about their workplace rights - particularly minimum pay rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors recently received intelligence suggesting that some Korean employees were receiving as little as $8 an hour. The current national minimum wage in Australia is $16.37 an hour, or $622.20 a week. Casual employees covered by the national minimum wage get $20.30 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says all employees working in Australia, including overseas workers, are entitled to basic rights and protections in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Every employee is legally entitled to a minimum wage and a range of other workplace entitlements, even if they’re not an Australian citizen," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "A key role of the Fair Work Ombudsman is to assist both employers and employees to understand their rights and obligations, including what they should pay or be paid."
     </p>
     <p>
      Information to assist both employers and employees from non-English speaking backgrounds has been translated into 27 languages, including Korean, on the Fair Work Ombudsman website at
      <a href="/language-help/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/languages
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      As well as educating people about their workplace rights, the Fair Work Ombudsman can investigate employee complaints and enforce compliance with Australia's workplace laws. Last financial year, the Agency recovered $1.4 million for more than 2000 Visa holders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recently, a Korean national at a restaurant in Sydney was back-paid $12,100 in wages after Fair Work inspectors discovered he had been underpaid over nine months. The waiter, who spoke limited English, was paid $15 an hour, below the minimum wage, and not enough to cover weekend penalty rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      In separate case, 10 workers at a fast food business in Sydney - most of them young Korean nationals - were back-paid a total of $5900 after their employer failed to pay out their annual leave entitlements on termination of employment in 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both employers co-operated with inspectors and reimbursed all money owed to employees voluntarily without the need for the Fair Work Ombudsman to take further action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is constantly looking to new and innovative ways to ensure overseas workers in Australia receive their lawful entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year, after an issue about underpaid overseas workers in Queensland, a social media campaign to educate seasonal workers, including backpackers, about their rights, reached almost 300,000 people. Facebook messages also reached 6500 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the Fair Work Ombudsman identifies underpayments of employees, its first preference is always to work co-operatively with employers to have them understand their mistakes and rectify them voluntarily - and to put processes in place to ensure the errors are not repeated.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, where an employer deliberately fails to comply with workplace laws or refuses to engage with Fair Work inspectors, the Fair Work Ombudsman has a number of enforcement options at its disposal, including litigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest penalty awarded by the Courts so far is $343,860 in September last year against a Perth cleaning company and its manager who were found to have deliberately underpaid six cleaners, including five overseas workers from Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Ireland.
