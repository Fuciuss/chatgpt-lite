     <p>
      <strong>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman filed a notice of discontinuance in relation to this matter on 14 March 2017.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An overseas worker employed as a trolley collector in NSW was underpaid $26,000 in less than four months, the Fair Work Ombudsman claims.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Korean national, in Australia on the 417 working holiday visa, was allegedly often required to work long hours of unpaid overtime.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 26-year-old, who spoke little English, worked as a trolley collector at the Woolworths supermarket site at
      <strong>
       Punchbowl
      </strong>
      between January 12 and April 20 last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today announced it had commenced legal proceedings against his employer, Sydney man David Kim and his trolley collection and cleaning company, Green World Management Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged Mr Kim generally required the employee to work from 9 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. It is alleged the employee was generally paid a flat weekly rate of $701.25, based on a 38-hour week.
     </p>
     <p>
      He was allegedly paid little or nothing for the overtime he performed most weeks, despite being entitled to receive between $27.02 and $45.03 an hour for the work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Workplace laws relating to pay slips, record-keeping, annual leave entitlements and requiring employees to work unreasonable additional hours were also allegedly breached.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, Mr Kim and his company allegedly breached frequency-of-pay laws by withholding the employee’s first week’s wages as a “bond”, before paying it to him three months later.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Kim fully rectified the alleged $26,308 underpayment of the employee after being contacted by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the alleged underpayment when it conducted a proactive audit of Green World Management last year as part of a national Inquiry into Woolworths’ trolley collection services.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the second litigation flowing from the Inquiry. Action against a former operator of a trolley collection company at
      <strong>
       Wagga
      </strong>
      was announced last week:
      <a href="/about-us/news-and-media-releases/archived-media-releases/2016-media-releases/may-2016/20160517-civic-national-litigation">
       Trolley-collection company faces Court
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      A decision was made to commence legal action because of the seriousness of the matter and the involvement of a vulnerable overseas worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Kim faces penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention of workplace laws, while Green World Management Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention. The matter will be heard in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
