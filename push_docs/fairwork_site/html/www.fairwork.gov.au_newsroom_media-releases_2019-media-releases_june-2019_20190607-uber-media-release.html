      <strong>

      The Fair Work Ombudsman has completed its investigation relating to Uber Australia Pty Ltd (Uber Australia) and its engagement of drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said that inspectors examined a wide range of evidence, including drivers’ contracts, log on and log off records, interviews with drivers and Uber Australia, ABN documents, payment statements, banking records and pricing schedules.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The weight of evidence from our investigation establishes that the relationship between Uber Australia and the drivers is not an employment relationship,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “For such a relationship to exist, the courts have determined that there must be, at a minimum, an obligation for an employee to perform work when it is demanded by the employer.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our investigation found that Uber Australia drivers are not subject to any formal or operational obligation to perform work,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Uber Australia drivers have control over whether, when, and for how long they perform work, on any given day or on any given week.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “Uber Australia does not require drivers to perform work at particular times and this was a key factor in our assessment that the commercial arrangement between the company and the drivers does not amount to an employment relationship,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “As a consequence, the Fair Work Ombudsman will not take compliance action in relation to this matter.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “This investigation related solely to Uber Australia and was not an investigation of the gig economy more generally,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Companies in the gig economy use a range of business models and the Fair Work Ombudsman will continue to assess allegations of non-compliance on a case-by-case basis. Anyone with concerns about their employment arrangements should contact the FWO.
