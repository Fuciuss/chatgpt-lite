      About the package
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Workplace relations in Australia presentation package has been designed to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       provide you (the lead trainer of the LSU) with foundational knowledge about Australian workplace relations
      </li>
      <li>
       help you deliver the presentation to your existing or new LSU colleagues.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The purpose of the package isn’t for LSU staff to become Australian workplace relations experts. The package is designed to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       equip LSU staff with essential workplace relations knowledge so they can help prepare Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme employees before they arrive in Australia
      </li>
      <li>
       provide information about referring matters to us.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The package includes a presentation, fact sheet and survey. You can find more information about these and download them below.
