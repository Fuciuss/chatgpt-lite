     </p>
     <p>
      The operator of a
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      labour-hire company is facing Court for allegedly underpaying 19 overseas workers more than $45,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced proceedings against Sydney woman Yan Hu and the company she operates, Global Express Consultancy Pty Ltd, in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were allegedly underpaid between February, 2014 and May, 2015, when working at three factories in Sydney.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees, from Taiwan and Hong Kong, were in Australia on 417 working holiday visas.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms Hu’s company supplied the employees to work at:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        A
        <strong>
         Taren Point
        </strong>
        factory operated by Banquet Desserts Pty Ltd, which supplies cheesecakes and muffins to Coles and Woolworths,
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        A factory at
        <strong>
         Mascot
        </strong>
        operated by Vienna Schubert Estia Pty Ltd, which supplies patisserie products to organisations including hospitality businesses, airlines and schools, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        A
        <strong>
         Kirrawee
        </strong>
        factory operated by South Pack Laboratories Pty Ltd, which operates a business packing vitamins and other non-prescription complementary medicines.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were allegedly underpaid their minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, Saturday penalty rates and overtime rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is alleged that some of the employees also had “bonds” of up to $300 unlawfully deducted from their wages. Pay-slip laws were allegedly also contravened.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors investigated after employees contacted the Agency for assistance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says a decision was made to commence litigation because the alleged underpayment was not rectified and vulnerable overseas workers were involved.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms Hu faces penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention and Global Express Consultancy faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for the company to back-pay the employees and to commission an audit of its compliance with workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A directions hearing is listed for February 5 in the Federal Circuit Court in Sydney.
