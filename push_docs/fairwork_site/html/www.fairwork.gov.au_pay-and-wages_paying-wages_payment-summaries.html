      Income statements
     </h3>
     <p>
      There have been changes to the way some employers need to report payroll information to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This includes payments such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       salaries and wages
      </li>
      <li>
       pay as you go (PAYG) withholding
      </li>
      <li>
       superannuation information.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      This change is called Single Touch Payroll (STP).
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employer reports using STP, they don't have to give employees an end-of-year payment summary. An employee’s end-of-year payment summary - now called an income statement - is available through their myGov account. Go to the ATO’s website to learn more about

     <h3>
      Payment summaries
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a workplace isn’t using STP to report yet, employees should receive a summary of employee income.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is called a payment summary, pay as you go (PAYG) payment summary or a ‘group certificate’.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer should advise employees whether they will be receiving a payment summary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment summaries are an extra pay slip and record-keeping requirement that is enforced by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). For more information on providing payment summaries, employers can visit the ATO’s
