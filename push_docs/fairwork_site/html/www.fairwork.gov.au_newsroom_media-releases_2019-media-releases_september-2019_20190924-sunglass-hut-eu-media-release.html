     <p>
      Sunglass Hut will back-pay $2.3 million to employees after breaching Australia’s workplace laws and underpaying 620 staff at stores across the country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Luxottica Retail Australia Pty Ltd, trading as Sunglass Hut, has entered into a Court-Enforceable Undertaking with the Fair Work Ombudsman after self-disclosing that it underpaid 620 current and former employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Between 2010 and 2016, Sunglass Hut failed to agree in writing with its part-time workers on a regular pattern of working hours and days, in breach of the General Retail Industry Award. The company therefore failed to pay overtime rates for work performed outside regular hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result, Sunglass Hut underpaid workers a total of $2,294,496 in overtime wages, with individual underpayments ranging from $4 up to $42,912.
     </p>
     <p>
      To date, Sunglass Hut has back-paid $1,485,590 to 457 staff, and must back-pay the outstanding $815,391 in unpaid overtime wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The affected workers were part-time retail staff who served customers in-store. Underpayments occurred at 253 Sunglass Hut stores across every state and territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said that a Court-Enforceable Undertaking was appropriate as the company had committed to overhauling workplace practices and rectifying all underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Sunglass Hut breached workplace laws and their conduct falls short of lawful obligations to their employees, and community expectations,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This matter highlights that if employers incorrectly apply award conditions, it can have extensive and expensive consequences across the business for years to come.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “This outcome should also serve as a warning to all businesses that they need to actively check that they are paying their staff correctly,” Ms Parker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sunglass Hut must fund external auditors to check pay and conditions for workers every year until the EU expires in 2022. The audits will cover part-time, full-time and casual workers and any underpayments must be rectified.
     </p>
     <p>
      Luxottica Retail Australia Pty Ltd must also issue a letter of apology to each of the affected workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company has admitted that it breached workplace laws. In addition to back-paying staff, Sunglass Hut will make a gesture of contrition through a $50,000 payment to the National Association of Community Legal Centres.
