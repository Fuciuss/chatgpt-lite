      Requesting annual leave

     <p>
      An employee needs to request to take annual leave before going on leave. The process for requesting annual leave is often set out in an award or

       registered agreement
      </a>
      , company policy or contract of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer can only refuse an employee's request for annual leave if the refusal is reasonable.

      Cancelling annual leave
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employers or employees may want to cancel approved annual leave in some situations.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, an employer may want to cancel an employee’s leave because the business is busier than usual and they need more staff working.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer or an employee can only cancel approved annual leave if the cancellation isn’t unreasonable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Awards, enterprise agreements, employment contracts and workplace policies may have extra rules about cancelling approved annual leave. Make sure you check what applies to you.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Employers cancelling annual leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before cancelling an employee’s leave, employers should consider:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       whether any costs have been incurred by the employee (for example, if the employee has paid a deposit for activities during their leave)
      </li>
      <li>
       how much notice of the cancellation is given.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      Employees cancelling annual leave
     </h3>
     <p>
      If an employee asks to cancel their approved annual leave, an employer shouldn’t unreasonably refuse the request.

      How much annual leave can be taken at one time
     </h2>
     <p>
      There's no minimum or maximum amount of annual leave that can be taken at a time. Provided the employer and employee agree, an employee can take a:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       part day
      </li>
      <li>
       single day, or
      </li>
      <li>
       number of days or weeks off.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Employees don't need to take all their annual leave at once.
