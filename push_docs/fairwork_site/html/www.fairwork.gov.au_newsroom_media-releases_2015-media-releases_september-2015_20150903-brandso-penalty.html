      The former operator of an
      <strong>
       Alice Springs
      </strong>
      café has been fined for record-keeping failures discovered during a Fair Work Ombudsman campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Federal Circuit Court in Darwin has imposed a $1500 penalty against Christopher Brandso, who until June, operated the Red Dog Café in the Todd Mall in partnership with his wife.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors randomly audited the café last year as part of proactive efforts to ensure Alice Springs businesses are paying employees their full entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legal action was initiated after Brandso ignored repeated requests from inspectors to provide employment records.
     </p>
     <p>
      He then admitted his business had failed to keep any.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the penalty is a reminder to business owners that maintaining appropriate employment records is not optional.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Failing to keep records is a serious matter because it increases the risk of staff underpayments occurring and hampers the ability of inspectors to determine if employees are being paid correctly,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says Brandso could have avoided legal action if he had engaged with Fair Work inspectors, but his lack of co-operation left the Agency with no option.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We always prefer to resolve matters by agreement, but we are prepared to take legal action in situations where business operators simply refuse to deal with us,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the penalty, the Court ordered Brandso to complete the Hiring Employees course on the Online Learning Centre at www.fairwork.gov.au – and provide the Fair Work Ombudsman with evidence of having done so.
     </p>

      The Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
