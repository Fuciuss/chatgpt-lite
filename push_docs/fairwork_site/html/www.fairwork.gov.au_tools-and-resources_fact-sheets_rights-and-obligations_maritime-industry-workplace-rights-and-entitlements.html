     <h3>
      Ships operating in Australian waters
     </h3>
     <p>
      The FW Act applies to any fixed platform and some ships operating in Australian territorial waters, the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone or waters above the Continental Shelf (collectively referred to as ‘Australian waters’ for the purposes of this fact sheet).

     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a ship registered on the Australian General Shipping Register (AGSR). The Register is maintained by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), who can be contacted on +61 2 6279 5000 or at

      </li>
      <li>
       a majority Australian-crewed ship.

     <ul>
      <li>
       foreign-flagged ships (other than some licensed ships or a majority Australian-crewed ship) exercising a right of innocent passage or transit passage through Australian waters
      </li>
      <li>
       ships registered on the Australian International Shipping Register (AISR), which are engaged in international trading.
      </li>

      Ships engaged in coastal trading
     </h3>
     <p>
      Coastal trading involves the movement of passengers or cargo between Australian ports for commercial purposes. Ships engaging in coastal trading are licenced under the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012 (licensed ships).
     </p>
     <p>
      The FW Act applies to ships engaged in coastal trading (including foreign-flagged ships) if they:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       are operating under a general, transitional or emergency licence, or
      </li>
      <li>

       <ul>
        <li>
         made at least 2 other voyages under either a temporary licence or single voyage permit in the last 12 months, or
        </li>
        <li>
         held a continuous voyage permit in the previous 15 months.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      (See regulation 1.15 of the

     </p>
     <p>
      The FW Act applies from the day that loading begins until the day that unloading ends.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts issues licences for ships engaged in coastal trading. For more information about licences please phone +61 2 6274 7474 or email

     <h3>
      Ships operating outside Australian waters
     </h3>
     <p>
      The FW Act applies outside of Australian waters to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a ship registered on the AGSR (wherever located)
      </li>
      <li>
       ships operated or chartered by an Australian employer who uses Australia as a base
      </li>
      <li>
       Australian employers in the Australian Antarctic Territory
      </li>
      <li>
       Australian-based employees in the Australian Antarctic Territory.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The FW Act doesn't apply to ships registered on the AISR that are engaged in international trading.
     </p>
     <p>
      Parts of the FW Act may also apply outside Australian waters to Australian-based employees and their employers (including an employer that is not an Australian employer). You should seek specific advice about which parts of the FW Act apply in these circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Parts of the FW Act relating to general protections apply to Australian employers outside Australian waters for all of their employees (whether or not the employee is Australian-based).

     <div class="highlight grey">
      <p>
