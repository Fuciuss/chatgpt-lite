      <strong>

     <p>
      A number of workers in Melbourne’s western suburbs have been back-paid almost $55,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest recovery was for four young casual waitresses at a café in the Watergardens Town Centre shopping complex at
      <strong>
       Taylors Lakes
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      They were underpaid a total of $13,000 between June, 2013 and October, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      After buying the café, the owner continued the previous employer’s practice of paying flat rates, rather than checking the wage rates applicable to the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were paid $16 an hour, which was below minimum they should have received under the Restaurant Industry Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, two male and two female employees at an eatery in the Highpoint shopping complex at
      <strong>
       Maribyrnong
      </strong>
      have also been back-paid a total of $7586.
     </p>
     <p>
      The part-time and casual employees were underpaid their minimum hourly rates, casual loadings and weekend penalty rates between July, 2013 and May, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries in the western suburbs include
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $7500 for a casual employee at an
       <strong>
        Altona North
       </strong>
       retail outlet underpaid minimum shift pay and minimum hourly rates,
      </li>
      <li>
       $5900 for a 19-year-old employee at a
       <strong>
        Maribyrnong
       </strong>
       restaurant unpaid her minimum hourly rates and overtime rates,
      </li>
      <li>
       $13,100 for a manager at a manufacturing business in
       <strong>
        Laverton North
       </strong>
       underpaid redundancy entitlements, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $7600 for an employee at an
       <strong>
        Altona North
       </strong>
       security company underpaid redundancy and annual leave entitlements.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says all employees were reimbursed without the need for further enforcement action after inspectors contacted the employers and explained their obligations under workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the cases are timely reminders for employers of the importance of ensuring they check the minimum lawful pay rates that apply to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      She says the Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply.
