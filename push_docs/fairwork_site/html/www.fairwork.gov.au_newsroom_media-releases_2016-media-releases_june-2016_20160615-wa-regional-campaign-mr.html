      <strong>
       15 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of a recent campaign in Western Australia’s
      <strong>
       Gascoyne
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Mid-West
      </strong>
      regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spot checks of 118 employers last year found that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       92 (78 per cent) were compliant with their record-keeping and pay-slip obligations,
      </li>
      <li>
       83 (70 per cent) were paying their employees correctly, and
      </li>
      <li>
       66 (56 per cent) were complaint with all their workplace responsibilities.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ten businesses were asked to back-pay a total of $107,014 to 121 of their employees who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      One employer had to reimburse staff $23,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business received a Letter of Caution putting it on notice that future breaches of workplace laws could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Mark Scully says all employers co-operated with the Agency and rectified the underpayments voluntarily.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Gascoyne and Mid-West regions were selected for attention in response to persistent requests for assistance from employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses were randomly selected in
      <strong>
       Carnarvon
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Coral Bay
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Exmouth,
      </strong>
      <strong>
       Denham
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Geraldton
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Meekatharra
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Paraburdoo
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Kalbarri
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Newman
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors focused on a range of industry sectors, including agriculture, accommodation and food services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Scully says businesses found to be non-complaint during the campaign will be re-audited as part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s ongoing National Compliance Monitoring Campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are committed to creating a culture if compliance in Australian workplaces," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "One of the aims of the campaign was to ensure employers were aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to understand and comply with them."
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors informed employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
