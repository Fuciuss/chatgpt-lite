      The Fair Work Ombudsman's small business helpline has responded to more than 50,000 calls from small business operators since it was launched in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      The priority service was created to provide reliable and credible information to the small business sector in recognition that many small business people are time-poor.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Small business operators engage in a wide variety of tasks every day, and sometimes they need extra assistance with payroll and human resources issues that arise in their workplace," Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said today.
     </p>
     <p>
      She said 3000 calls a week was a positive response to the initiative.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says most of the callers had sought advice on wages, employee leave entitlements and dismissal processes.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Small businesses often don't have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on assisting them to get the information and advice they need as easily as possible," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I acknowledge small business people are juggling a multitude of tasks - and this helpline allows them to get the information they need in a fast and convenient way.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This is a priority service that has been designed to help people who want to do the right thing. It is an education and advisory service, not a compliance tool."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says her Agency has expanded - and will continue to expand - its suite of free tools and resources to assist businesses ensure they are getting things right.
     </p>
     <p>
      A guide to hiring new employees has recently been produced to aid small business operators with straight-forward advice about recruiting staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      It gives plain-English advice about the best way to employ new workers and outlines workplace obligations in simple terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We want to assist small business recruit the right people and grow their business by understanding the process of hiring staff," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The guide, which has step-by-step processes and best practice recruitment tips, can be downloaded at
      <a href="/find-help-for/small-business/hiring-employees">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/hiring
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The resource is complemented by a free interactive online learning course employers can use to improve their skills in hiring and inducting new staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The course includes an interactive tool to help employers build a profile of the employee they want to hire and a video activity to help them practice their interview skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      The course is available at the Online Learning Centre on the Fair Work Ombudsman's website at
      <a href="/how-we-will-help/online-training/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/learning
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Feedback was sought from a number of representative bodies and business groups when creating the guide and online learning course.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We're serious about getting input from those who are part of the small business community, and tailoring our services to be of genuine help in day-to-day operations, so consultation is a really important part of our work," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has a particular focus on assisting small businesses to understand and meet their obligations to employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      In March, the Fair Work Ombudsman met with members of the small business community at a Roundtable in Melbourne to discuss how the Fair Work agencies can better assist small business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The discussion was co-hosted by the Fair Work Ombudsman, Fair Work Commission General Manager Bernadette O'Neill and Director of Fair Work Building and Construction, Nigel Hadgkiss.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commonwealth Small Business Minister, the Hon. Bruce Billson, also attended the forum, spoke to participants and fielded questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the aim of the Roundtable was to hear first-hand how the small business community could be further supported to make their interactions with workplace laws as straightforward as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has recently established a dedicated Small Business Strategy Team that has been tasked with responding to the needs of small businesses.
     </p>
