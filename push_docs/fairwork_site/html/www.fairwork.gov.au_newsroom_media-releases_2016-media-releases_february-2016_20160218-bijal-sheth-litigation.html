       The operator of a cleaning services business in
       <strong>
        Brisbane
       </strong>
       is facing Court for allegedly underpaying four young overseas workers almost $60,000 and breaching sham contracting laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced action against Bijal Girish Sheth in the Federal Circuit Court.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Sheth and his company Brisclean Pty Ltd allegedly underpaid the four employees a total of $59,878 for work they performed between August, 2012 and December, 2014.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Brisclean was placed into administration late last year, restricting the Fair Work Ombudsman from pursuing legal action against it.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       As such, the Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking civil penalties against Mr Sheth and a Court Order for him to personally back-pay the workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Sheth allegedly breached sham contracting laws by deliberately misclassifying the employees as contractors.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He allegedly paid the workers low, flat rates and did not pay them at all for some work performed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This allegedly resulted in underpayment of their minimum hourly rates, annual leave entitlements, part-time and shift loadings and penalty rates for weekend public holiday and overtime work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The workers were allegedly underpaid individual amounts of $26,492, $22,545, $6679 and $4162.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Sheth allegedly contravened record-keeping and pay-slip obligations and failed to comply with three Notices to Produce employment records issued by Fair Work inspectors.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Fair Work Ombudsman treats very seriously the underpayment of vulnerable employees, such as overseas workers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She says the employer’s failure to engage with the Fair Work Ombudsman and comply with multiple requests to assist the Agency’s investigation was a factor in deciding to litigate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Mr Sheth faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention, in addition to an Order to back-pay the workers in full.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman has had previous requests for assistance from employees working for Mr Sheth and Brisclean.
