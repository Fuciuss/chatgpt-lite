      <strong>
       25 May 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Three Chinese backpackers fruit-picking in
      <strong>
       regional Victoria
      </strong>
      are among dozens of workers back-paid thousands of dollars following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The backpackers, all 417 working holiday visa-holders, were short-changed their minimum hourly rates of pay while working for five months last year on a property at
      <strong>
       Murchison
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      They have been reimbursed a total of $9800, an average of $3266 each, after turning to the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance after leaving their jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer was underpaying casual wage rates, but after discussions with Fair Work inspectors, agreed to reimburse the former workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      “When we find mistakes, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure the errors are not repeated,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says this and other recent cases highlight the importance of
      <strong>
       Goulburn Murray
      </strong>
      employers taking the time to ensure they understand their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      She revealed that local employers had been required to reimburse about $70,000 to underpaid workers following recent inquiries.
     </p>
     <p>
      “A small mistake left over time can easily result in a hefty bill for back-payment of wages – so it is important employers get it right in the first place,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, a café at
      <strong>
       Cobram
      </strong>
      has also been required to return $25,600 to 11 of its staff who were found to have been underpaid over 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Waiting staff, cooks and apprentices were underpaid their minimum hourly rates and penalty rates for weekend, overtime, public holiday and shift work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpayments occurred as a result of the employer’s failure to pass on annual increases to minimum pay rates and pay some workers under the correct Modern Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman identified the mistake during a random audit of the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $9800 for five farm hands at a
       <strong>
        Kyabram
       </strong>
       property not paid their casual loading entitlements,
      </li>
      <li>
       $9200 for 11 employees at a
       <strong>
        Broadford
       </strong>
       retail business underpaid their minimum hourly rates, early morning penalty rates, laundry allowances and paid rest break entitlements,
      </li>
      <li>
       $7600 for four apprentices at an
       <strong>
        Alexandra
       </strong>
       business underpaid their minimum hourly rates, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5400 for a truck driver at
       <strong>
        Shepparton
       </strong>
       underpaid his night penalty rates over 12 months.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms James encouraged employers in the Goulburn Murray region to go to www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      if they were unsure of their responsibilities.
