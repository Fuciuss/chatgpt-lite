      More than 12,000 users - mostly small business people - have taken a free course at the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Online Learning Centre since it launched a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Online Learning Centre is available at
      <a href="/tools-and-resources/online-learning-centre/default">
       www.fairwork.gov.au/learning
      </a>
      and has a range of interactive courses for business owners and employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the courses have been designed for employers who want to broaden their workplace knowledge, update their skills and discover new and more productive ways of working.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are always looking for new and innovative ways to help businesses understand and meet their obligations and acquire the knowledge they need to run their business in a productive way,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <em>
       Difficult conversation in the workplace course has
      </em>
      practical tips to help employers develop skills and confidence to have difficult conversations in the workplace, minimise disputes and achieve productive results.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Hiring new employees
      </em>
      includes an interactive tool to help employers build a profile of the employee they want to hire and a video activity to practice their interview skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      A new course titled
      <em>
       Managing Performance
      </em>
      will be released in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has accredited
      <em>
       Difficult conversations in the workplace
      </em>
      as a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) point for its members.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sue Bond, Head of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia’s Pharmacy Academy, says the course continues to be a popular choice for members undergoing professional development.
     </p>
     <p>
      “
      <em>
       Difficult conversations in the workplace
      </em>
      receives a consistently high level of enrolments. Almost 1000 pharmacists have chosen to complete the course as part of their CPD,” Ms Bond said.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of private companies and government agencies have also asked to provide the courses to their employees as part of their own professional development programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our courses are compatible with most learning management systems, which means businesses can integrate them into their own staff training programs – and we’ve already had eight organisations take advantage of this opportunity,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Free courses for employees are also available on topics such as
      <em>
       Starting a New Job
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Difficult conversations in the workplace
      </em>
      .
