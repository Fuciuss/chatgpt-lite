      From the first pay period starting on or after 30 June 2023, there are new and updated classifications and transitional minimum rates for employees with disability covered by the Supported Employment Services Award.

     <h3>
      New classifications
     </h3>
     <p>
      From 30 June 2023, new Grade A and Grade B classifications have been added to the Award. These are in addition to the existing Grade 1 – 7 classifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Grades A and B apply to employees who:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       because of their disability, are unable to undertake the duties or exercise the level of skill and responsibility of a job in Grades 1 – 7
      </li>
      <li>
       are in a job that doesn’t fall into Grades 1 – 7
      </li>
      <li>
       are in a job that requires a level of supervision and monitoring to accommodate the effects of their disability.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h4>
      Grade A
     </h4>
     <p>
      Grade A is a job that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       consists of a simple task or tasks of up to 3 steps
      </li>
      <li>
       has steps that may involve using jigs, basic equipment or tools
      </li>
      <li>
       is under direct supervision
      </li>
      <li>
       has constant monitoring.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The minimum rate of pay for a full-time or part-time Grade A employee is $5.02 per hour from the first pay period starting on or after 1 July 2023.
     </p>
     <h4>
      Grade B
     </h4>
     <p>
      Grade B is a job that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       consists of a simple task or tasks of more than 3 steps
      </li>
      <li>
       has steps that may involve using mechanical or electrical equipment or tools
      </li>
      <li>
       is under direct supervision
      </li>
      <li>
       has regular monitoring.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The minimum rate of pay for a full-time or part-time Grade B employee is $10.05 per hour from the first pay period starting on or after 1 July 2023.
     </p>
     <p>
      Grade A and B casual employees get a 25% loading on top of the minimum hourly rate of pay.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Changing classifications
     </h3>
     <p>
      The classifications in Grades 1 to 7 also changed from 30 June 2023.
     </p>
     <p>
      The classifications between Grades 1 and 7 in the SES Award can apply to employees with or without disability, based on their qualifications, training, experience and duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers need to determine the classification for new employees starting work from 30 June 2023 using the new classification structure. This is based on the employee’s qualifications, training experience and duties.

      Changes to supported wage assessments
     </h2>
     <p>
      Employees with disability covered by the SES Award can be paid a supported wage. This is the higher of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       a percentage of the minimum hourly rate of pay for their classification based on their productive capacity, or
      </li>
      <li>
       $2.90 per hour.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employee’s productive capacity is assessed based on their ability to perform their job. This is determined by an approved assessor using an assessment tool outlined in the SES Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The only supported wage assessment tool that can be used under the SES Award is the Supported Wage System (SWS). All other tools have been removed from the SES Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee with disability covered by the SES Award doesn’t have to be paid a supported wage. An employer can pay an employee with disability the minimum rate for the employee’s classification.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Employees with disability employed at 30 June 2023
     </h3>
     <p>
      From 30 June 2023, there are transitional arrangements about not reducing wages and conducting SWS assessments for employees with disability already employed. These apply to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employees classified into Grade A or B
      </li>
      <li>
       employees assessed under the SWS.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Any employee with disability employed at 30 June 2023, who the SWS applies to but who didn't have a SWS wage assessment before that date, will need to have an initial SWS wage assessment done before 30 June 2026. These employees will stay on their current wage rate until the assessment is done. That rate must increase by the same percentage and at the same time as any annual wage review increase to the Grade 2 rate in the Award.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer can’t reduce the hourly rate of an employee who was employed at 1 January 2023 as a result of:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       being classified into Grade A or B by their employer, or
      </li>
      <li>
       having an initial SWS wage assessment conducted between 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2026 that assesses them as having lower capacity.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      New employees with disability employed from 30 June 2023
     </h3>
     <p>
      New employees employed after 30 June 2023 will be employed for a trial period of at least 13 weeks but no longer than 26 weeks. The trial should include appropriate induction or training.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the trial period, an assessment of capacity will be done to determine the employee’s minimum hourly rate of pay. The employee must be paid at least $2.90 per hour for each hour worked in this period.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the new employee is assessed at a higher rate of pay than $2.90 per hour, their employer must pay them at the higher rate. The higher rate starts 13 weeks after the trial commenced.

      New employees from 30 June 2023

     <p>
      New employees with disability employed from 30 June 2023 will have a review of their wage assessment after 12 months’ service with the employer. Depending on the results of the assessment, their pay rate may be adjusted.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the employee changes jobs or the processes involved in their work changes, the employer or employee can request a review once every 6 months. This can happen up to a maximum of 4 times every 3 years. Their pay rate may be adjusted as a result.

     <ul>
      <li>
       until 3 years after that assessment,

      Right to request a review
     </h3>
     <p>
      From 30 June 2023, employees have a right to request a review of their classification. There is also a dispute resolution process outlined in the award if problems arise when reviewing the employees classification. See clause 31.5 and D.5.6 of Schedule D listed in the
