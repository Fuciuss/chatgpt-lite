      The Fair Work Ombudsman has today released the results of its proactive education and compliance campaign targeting
      <strong>
       Tasmania’s south and east coasts
      </strong>
      , finding 31 per cent of audited businesses to be non-compliant with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign was initiated due to employment growth in a range of sectors across the region, including sectors that employ a high proportion of young workers and visa holders such as accommodation and food services, and manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors audited the time and wage records of 55 businesses across
      <strong>
       Orford
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Triabunna
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Swansea
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Bicheno
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Scamander
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result of the campaign, $9,580 was recovered for 11 employees, with individual recovery amounts ranging from $111 to $3835.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Inspectors issued two formal cautions, two infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) and one compliance notice during the campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      In one matter, a motel was found to have failed to meet the minimum hourly rate required under the relevant award in respect of four of its workers – half of its total workforce.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer was issued with a compliance notice and a total of $3579 was back-paid to the workers in accordance with the notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that non-compliant businesses in the region were now on notice that future breaches would not be tolerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “There has never been more freely available information to assist employers to understand and comply with their workplace obligations,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Businesses should be aware that ignorance is not an excuse and breaches of workplace law may attract enforcement action.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign found that 87 per cent of businesses were paying their employees correctly, and 80 per cent were compliant with record keeping and pay slip requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Significantly, all businesses found to be non-compliant were small businesses of less than 15 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says that small businesses remain a priority for her agency, noting that they may require additional support as they often lack dedicated payroll or human resources functions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I encourage small businesses in particular to register for a free

      with the Fair Work Ombudsman, which is an easy way to remain informed and receive tailored information relevant to your business,” Ms James said.
