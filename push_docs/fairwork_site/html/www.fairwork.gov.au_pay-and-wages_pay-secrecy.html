      When these rights apply
     </h3>
     <p>
      These workplace rights apply to employees with:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       employment contracts that were entered into on or after 7 December 2022, or
      </li>
      <li>
       employment contracts entered into before 7 December 2022 where the contract doesn’t include pay secrecy terms that are inconsistent with these rights.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Where a contract entered into before 7 December 2022 has pay secrecy terms that are inconsistent with these rights, and the contract is changed after 7 December 2022, these rights apply after the contract is changed.

      Pay secrecy terms

     <p>
      Pay secrecy terms are terms in employment contracts, awards or agreements that are inconsistent with the workplace rights described above.

     <p>
      From 7 December 2022:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       pay secrecy terms that are included in employment contracts entered into on or after this date have no effect and can’t be enforced
      </li>
      <li>
       pay secrecy terms can’t be included in other new written agreements and employers could face penalties if they do include them.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      From 7 June 2023, pay secrecy terms can’t be included in employment contracts at all. Employers who enter into employment contracts that have pay secrecy terms in them could face penalties.

      <h4>
       Example: New employment contract with pay secrecy terms
      </h4>
      <p>
       Peppa is thinking about accepting a job as a medical receptionist at her local general practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peppa is given an employment contract to sign that says she isn’t allowed to discuss her pay with anyone. A friend tells Peppa that they think this rule in her contract isn’t right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before she signs the contract, Peppa decides to check what laws apply on our website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peppa learns that for employment contracts made on or after 7 December 2022, a pay secrecy term has no effect and can’t be enforced. She also learns that she has a right to talk about her pay with anyone if she wants to. This means that the pay secrecy term in her proposed contract has no effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peppa talks to the employer about these laws. The employer agrees to take the pay secrecy term out and gives her a new version of the contract to consider.

      Pay secrecy terms in employment contracts entered into before 7 December 2022 will continue to operate, until those contracts are varied.

       Jonah works in a call centre. He entered into an employment contract in August 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonah’s contract has a pay secrecy term that prevents him from discussing his pay (such as his weekly wage and any annual bonuses) with other employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jonah’s pay secrecy term is still in effect because he agreed to it before 7 December 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any pay secrecy terms agreed to before 7 December 2022 continue to operate until the contract is changed.

      New or existing fair work instruments (awards and agreements)

     <p>
      Fair work instruments are legal workplace documents such as awards or enterprise agreements. They’re separate from employment contracts or workplace policies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pay secrecy terms in a fair work instrument have no effect and can’t be enforced after 7 December 2022. This applies regardless of whether the instrument was made before, on, or after this date.
