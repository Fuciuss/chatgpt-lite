      <strong>
       26 August 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Recruitment and Consulting Services Association is joining forces with the Fair Work Ombudsman to help improve compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      It has signed a formal Memorandum of Understanding with the Fair Work Ombudsman. Similar MoUs are also in place with a number of other industry, union and regulatory bodies.
     </p>
     <p>
      They include the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority (VRQA), Accommodation Association of Australia (AAoA), Australian Hotels Association (AHA), Restaurant and Catering Association (RCA), Australian Security Industry Association Ltd (ASIAL), the National Union of Workers (NUW) and the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union (SDA).
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest MoU was signed in Melbourne by Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell and RCSA Chief Executive Officer Charles Cameron.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both have agreed to share information on issues relating to the labour-hire sector in a joint bid to promote and achieve workplace compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the MoU, the Fair Work Ombudsman has agreed to provide information to the RCSA on significant education, compliance and enforcement activities and outcomes involving employers, industry sectors or regions of mutual interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency will contribute to RCSA newsletters, web content, conferences and seminars and the bodies will meet formally at least twice yearly to discuss strategic and operational issues concerning the sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      “As part of our endeavours to create a culture of compliance in Australian workplaces, and our desire to work with as much information as is available, we welcome this MoU and look to the benefits it brings to both parties,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labour supply, particularly complex supply chain arrangements, has been a focus of the Fair Work Ombudsman as it works to protect vulnerable workers from exploitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency has identified a strong correlation between outsourcing of low skilled work, the prevalence of vulnerable workers in such labour markets, and worker exploitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Cameron said: “For every dodgy labour hire contractor, there is generally an irresponsible buyer and the criminal element only exists because these companies continue to turn a blind eye and don’t engage ethical labour supplies.’’
     </p>
     <p>
      “The onus must be upon the buyers of the services as much as it must be upon the labour suppliers. Money talks in the labour supply industry and this MoU is a further step towards turning off the tap for dodgy labour suppliers,’’ Mr Cameron added.
