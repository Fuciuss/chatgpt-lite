      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s legal action against Pioneer Facility Services and Pioneer Contracting Services (Pioneer companies) has been dismissed following an appeal.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2016, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced legal action against the Pioneer companies and a subcontractor – Mr Sung Gun Hwang and his company OzKorea Pty Ltd – in relation to alleged underpayments of Korean cleaners at four Woolworths sites in Tasmania.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year, the Federal Circuit Court found that the Pioneer companies were accessories to underpayment contraventions by OzKorea and Mr Hwang – and the Court imposed penalties of $17,000 against Pioneer Facility Services, $17,000 against Pioneer Contracting Services, $20,400 against OzKorea and $5,000 against Mr Hwang.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Pioneer companies appealed against liability and penalty and that appeal has now been allowed by consent in the Federal Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result, all penalties and findings of breaches against Pioneer Facility Services and Pioneer Contracting Services have been set aside and the Fair Work Ombudsman’s case has been dismissed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The findings and penalties against OzKorea and Mr Hwang are not affected by the appeal.
