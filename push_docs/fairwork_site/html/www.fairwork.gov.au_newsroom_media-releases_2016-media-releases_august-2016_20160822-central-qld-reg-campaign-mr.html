     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of a recent campaign in
      <strong>
       Central Queensland
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors made spot checks of 232 businesses in and around
      <strong>
       Rockhampton
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Yeppoon
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Gladstone
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Biloela
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Emerald
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Blackwater
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      They found that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       163 (70 per cent) were compliant with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations,
      </li>
      <li>
       160 (69 per cent) were paying their staff correctly, and
      </li>
      <li>
       115 (49 per cent) were compliant with all their workplace responsibilities.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Fifty one businesses were asked to back-pay a total of $110,087 to 316 of their employees who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says one employer was issued with a formal Letter of Caution, putting it on notice that future contraventions of workplace law could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the campaign was conducted in response to an increase in requests for assistance from employees in Central Queensland.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses audited were across a number of industries, including the accommodation sector, hair and beauty services and earthmoving.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says Fair Work inspectors noted that businesses which were members of industry or employer organisations had a higher compliance rate than those which were not.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, larger businesses had a higher compliance rate than smaller businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says those businesses with contraventions co-operated with the Agency and rectified them immediately.
     </p>
     <p>
      "One of the aims of the campaign was to ensure employers were aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to understand and comply with them," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are committed to creating a culture if compliance in Australian workplaces."
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors informed employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman's website at www.fairwork.gov.au.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can also contact the Fair Work Infoline on
      <strong>
       13 13 94
      </strong>
      . A free interpreter service is available by calling
      <strong>
       13 14 50.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Small businesses can opt to be put through to a priority service for assistance.
