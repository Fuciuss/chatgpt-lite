      You have the right to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       access documents
      </li>
      <li>
       ask for information about you to be changed or added if it's incomplete, out of date, incorrect or misleading
      </li>
      <li>
       ask for a review of our decision if we refuse you access to a document or change your details.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      If the document you want can't be released under our IA Policy, you can apply to access it under the FOI Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      We can refuse to release some documents, or parts of documents, if the FOI Act allows it. This includes documents that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       affect the enforcement of law
      </li>
      <li>
       are given to us in confidence
      </li>
      <li>
       are subject to legal professional privilege.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Documents that have business and personal information in them may not be released unless it is in the public interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will contact you to ask whether you agree to exclude public servants' names and contact details, where this information does not appear to be specifically relevant to the scope of an FOI request.
     </p>
     <p>
      To make an FOI request you need to put your request in writing with the following information:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       stating that you're making an application under the FOI Act
      </li>
      <li>
       provide detailed information about the document you want, so we can identify it quickly
      </li>
      <li>
       provide contact details so we can send you notices under the FOI Act (eg. email, postal, address or fax number).
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Send your request to us by:
     </p>

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We will always aim to send you a decision within the statutory timeframes allowed under the FOI Act. This generally means within 30 days from the day after we receive your request, but this timeframe will be extended if we have to consult with any third parties or for other reasons including the complexity of a request or the volume of documents sought. Like many government agencies, our staff’s ability to process FOI requests may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may seek applicants’ agreement to extend processing timeframes connected to some requests.

      Fees and charges

     <p>
      There's no application fee to make an FOI request.

     <p>
      There are no processing charges for documents containing your own personal information.

      When we've made a decision on your FOI request, we'll send you a letter explaining our decision and your review and appeal rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can ask for the following decisions to be reviewed:
     </p>

       if we refuse to give you access to all or part of a document or if we defer giving you access
      </li>
      <li>
       if we impose a charge
      </li>
      <li>
       if we refuse to change or add to the information about you that you claim is incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      A third party who disagrees with our decision to give you documents that have information about them can also ask for our decision to be reviewed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision will be reviewed internally by another officer in our agency. We'll tell you our decision within 30 days of getting your written request.
