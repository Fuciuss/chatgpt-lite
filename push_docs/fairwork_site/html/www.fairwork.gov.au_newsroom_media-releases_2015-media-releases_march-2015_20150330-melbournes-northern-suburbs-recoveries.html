      <strong>
       30 March 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Workers throughout
      <strong>
       Melbourne’s northern suburbs
      </strong>
      have been back-paid a total of $70,500 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The biggest recovery was $34,000 for a clerical worker at a
       <strong>
        Greensborough
       </strong>
       real estate agency who was underpaid over a period of two years.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee, aged in her 60s, was often paid only a fraction of the wages she was entitled to and sometimes went weeks without any income.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Her underpayment was the equivalent of nine months’ wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee continued working full-time under the presumption she would eventually be paid in full, incurring credit card debt to meet her daily living expenses.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employee contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman for assistance when her employment ended and she was still owed wages.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The business claimed its cash-flow problems were the cause of the problem, but agreed to reimburse the employee all outstanding entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says ensuring staff are paid the correct wages on time is one of the most fundamental workplace obligations for an employer.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Employees should not be put in a position where they may struggle to pay their bills because they haven’t been paid the correct wages on time,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Other recent recoveries include:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        $14,700 for seven child care workers at a
        <strong>
         Diamond Creek
        </strong>
        child care centre underpaid their overtime rates over a 12-month period in 2013-2014
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $9200 for 34 workers, including waiters, waitresses and kitchen hands, at a
        <strong>
         Carlton
        </strong>
        restaurant underpaid their overtime and late-night shift penalty rates over a six-month period in 2013
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $6400 for a warehouse worker at a
        <strong>
         Keilor East
        </strong>
        business underpaid the minimum hourly rate for just over 12 months in 2012-2013, and
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>
        $6200 for a delivery driver at a
        <strong>
         Thomastown
        </strong>
        automotive parts business underpaid the minimum hourly rate between 2010 and 2013.
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says while it was disappointing to identify the underpayments, it was pleasing to see the employers accept assistance from Fair Work inspectors and promptly reimburse all money owed.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We have a flexible and fair approach when inadvertent mistakes happen and employers are willing to co-operate with us to ensure they don’t occur in the future,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Last financial year the Fair Work Ombudsman resolved more than 25,000 requests for assistance from employees who believed they had been underpaid or treated unfairly.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       More than $23 million was recovered for over 15,000 underpaid workers nationally.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the overwhelming majority of employers want to do the right thing by their employees and get it right when it comes to workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We find that most mistakes are due to a lack of awareness of workplace laws, rather than employers deliberately doing the wrong thing,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says it is important to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure that those employers doing the right thing are not competitively disadvantaged.
