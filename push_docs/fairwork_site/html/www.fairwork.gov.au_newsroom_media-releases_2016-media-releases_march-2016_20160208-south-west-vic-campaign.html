       The Fair Work Ombudsman will audit up to 200 businesses across Victoria’s South-West region as part of a new campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      The three-month campaign will focus on businesses located in
      <strong>
       Warrnambool
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Colac
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Camperdown
      </strong>
      until the end of May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors will check employers are paying the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and providing appropriate meal breaks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations will also be monitored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The campaign is focusing on employers across various sectors, including cafes and restaurants, dairy cattle and sheep farming, building and industrial cleaning.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       All businesses will be randomly selected.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Key local employer groups and unions have been enlisted to help the Agency promote the campaign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says Victoria’s South-West region is home to thousands of businesses, with requests for assistance from workers up 27 per cent between 2011 and 2014.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says one of the aims of the campaign is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how the Agency can assist them to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check that workers are being paid correctly, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers understand their obligations,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Inspectors will make a number of face-to-face visits to businesses during the campaign so they can offer employers tailored assistance to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors will inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available to them on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, an Online learning centre and My Account, which enables employers and employees to save information on pay and conditions for their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Employers and employees seeking assistance can visit the website or call the Fair Work Infoline on
