      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s Online Learning Centre - which has attracted more than 17,000 users since it was launched last year - has been recognised for its use of educational videos.
     </p>
     <p>
      The resource has won a coveted Gold Award for Excellence in the ‘Best Use of Video for Learning’ category at the 2014 Brandon Hall Excellence Awards, an international award program for the E-Learning industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Online Learning Centre is available at www.fairwork.gov.au/learning and has a range of free interactive courses for both business owners and employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The courses cover topics such as difficult conversations at work, starting a new job, hiring employees and managing performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Agency is proud of the high quality online courses it provides for workplace participants.
     </p>
     <p>
      “They can assist employers and workers alike to develop a broad range of skills that can help them successfully manage issues at work,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman courses differ from many other online learning programs because they use videos which speak directly to the user.
     </p>
     <p>
      The use of first-person video immerses the user in workplace situations and helps them to develop key skills by experiencing situations and conversations first-hand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other leading organisations have also recognised the online courses as a valuable tool.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has accredited the
      <em>
       Difficult conversations in the workplace
      </em>
      course as a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) point for its members.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of private companies and government agencies have also asked to provide the courses to their employees as part of their own professional development programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our courses are compatible with most learning management systems, which means businesses can integrate them into their own staff training programs – and we’ve already had a number of organisations take advantage of this opportunity,” Ms James said.
