      How you can help your franchisees
     </h2>
     <p>
      A court will decide if a franchisor took reasonable steps to prevent their franchisee from breaching their obligations. You should take steps to enable, support and monitor your franchisees’ compliance.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Enable compliance
     </h3>
     <p>
      Make sure your franchise agreement clearly requires franchisees to comply with workplace laws. While the workplace laws apply even if it isn’t mentioned in the agreement, being clear about this can help set your expectations from them from the start.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should also make sure that the franchise’s business model takes into account the costs of lawfully employing enough staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Negotiating a
      <a data-href="/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2034" href="/taxonomy/term/407">
       registered agreement
      </a>
      for your franchise can create clarity and consistency about conditions of employment across the business. For information about how to make an enterprise agreement, visit the

     <h3>
      Monitor compliance
     </h3>
     <p>
      Regularly checking that your franchisees are complying with workplace laws will mean you are better placed to see and address issues before they become a problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before implementing new monitoring activities, check what your franchise agreement or business structure allows you to do and follow any privacy obligations that apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Monitoring activities include:
     </p>
     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>
       regular audits of pay slips and records to make sure franchisees are meeting their record-keeping obligations
      </li>
      <li>
       requiring franchisees to conduct ‘self-audits’ and report the results
      </li>
      <li>
       allowing employees to contact you for help if their complaints are not dealt with by the franchisee
      </li>
      <li>
       requiring franchisees to notify you if an employee has requested our assistance, or if we are auditing them
      </li>
      <li>
       encouraging franchisees to actively cooperate with our dispute resolution processes, investigations and audits.
