      <strong>
       2 August 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of two fish and chip shops in the
      <strong>
       Newcastle
      </strong>
      region of NSW have agreed to back-pay workers almost $40,000 following an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpaid employees worked at ‘Steel Street Fish Market’ outlets at the Marketown Shopping Centre and the Charlestown Square Shopping Centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors audited the businesses last year after receiving requests for assistance from employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      They found that 21 employees had been paid a flat rate of $18 for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Fast Food Industry Award
      </em>
      , they should have been paid up to $23.74 for ordinary hours, $28.49 on Saturdays, $33.24 on Sundays and $52.23 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      A clothing allowance, pay-in-lieu-of-notice entitlements, leave pay and overtime penalty rates were also underpaid and pay-slip requirements were not met.
     </p>
     <p>
      The underpaid workers include current and former employees who prepared take-away meals.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were underpaid a total of $38,344 between August, 2014 and September, 2015, with nine at Charlestown underpaid more than $21,000 and 12 at Marketown underpaid almost $17,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest individual underpayment was $10,950 for an employee at Charlestown.
     </p>
     <p>
      Operators Matthew Osborne and Steve Costi and their companies, SCS Corporate (Newcastle) Pty Ltd and CFFC Charlestown Pty Ltd, co-operated with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      They have back-paid all workers, except for several who cannot be located.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mr Osborne, Mr Costi and their companies have entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman aimed at encouraging behavioural change and future compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the terms of EU, they have agreed to engage an independent specialist to audit their compliance with federal workplace laws, upgrade systems and processes to ensure future compliance with workplace laws, apologise to all underpaid employees, display a workplace notice detailing the contraventions and register with the Fair Work Ombudsman's My Account portal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the fact that a Letter of Caution had previously been issued to the Charlestown business indicated a need for enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This matter highlights the need for employers to ensure they are aware of the minimum lawful pay rates their employees are entitled to, including penalty rates," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is committed to improving compliance rates in the fast food sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Audits of 565 take-away food businesses conducted during a recent national campaign finalised earlier this year found that 223 had short-changed 929 employees $582,410, with underpayment of minimum rates being the most prevalent wage error.
