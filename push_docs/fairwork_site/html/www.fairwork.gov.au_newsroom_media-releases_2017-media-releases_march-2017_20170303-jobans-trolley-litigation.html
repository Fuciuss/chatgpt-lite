       A trolley collection subcontractor is facing Court forallegedly exploiting two migrant workers at
       <strong>
        Bendigo
       </strong>
       , in regional Victoria, and using false records to try tocover it up.

       TheFair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action in the Federal Circuit Court againstJobanjeet Singh and his company Joban’s Trolley Collection Pty Ltd.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       TheFair Work Ombudsman alleges Mr Singh and his company underpaid two trolleycollection workers a total of $29,031 between January and June, 2015.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Theworkers were recent migrants from Afghanistan and Pakistan aged 32 and 29. Theyhad recently arrived as refugees and been granted permanent residency. Oneworker spoke limited English.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Joban’sTrolley Collection employed them to work at the Woolworths Bendigo Market Placeshopping centre as part of a subcontract it had at the time with United TrolleyCollections Pty Ltd. United Trolley Collection no longer holds any contractswith Joban’s Trolley Collection and Joban’s no longer operates at anyWoolworths sites.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       TheFair Work Ombudsman’s investigation revealed that the two workers had allegedlybeen paid rates ranging from $9.73 to $19.20 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Thisallegedly resulted in underpayment of their minimum hourly rates, shift-workloadings, overtime rates and penalty rates for weekend and public holiday work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Theywere allegedly also underpaid superannuation and annual leave entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Itis also alleged that during the investigation, Mr Singh and his companyknowingly provided Fair Work inspectors with false time-and-wages records thatoverstated the rates the two workers were paid.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       FairWork Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action has been commenced because ofthe involvement of vulnerable workers and the seriousness of the alleged conduct.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Employersshould be aware that we treat exploitation of migrant workers particularlyseriously,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       MrSingh faces maximum penalties of up to $10,800 per contravention and Joban’sTrolley Collection Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $54,000 per contraventionfor a number of alleged contraventions of the Fair Work Act.
      </span>
     </p>

       Thetwo workers came forward and lodged requests for assistance during the FairWork Ombudsman’s
