      A Centre for Workplace Leadership survey has provided further evidence that "happy and engaged employees" can have a direct impact on increased productivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      A business with a positive, motivated workforce is more likely to retain skilled and valued employees, have low absentee rates and minimum staff turnover.
     </p>
     <p>
      High morale in the workplace can give an employer a strong competitive advantage. So how does a business ensure its employees are happy?
     </p>
     <p>
      For many, there is more to being "happy and engaged" at work than what’s in the pay packet every fortnight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Knowing you are receiving your full lawful entitlements is obviously important, but it won’t necessarily motivate everyone to achieve their best.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those who give their utmost are usually part of a workplace culture that supports autonomy, innovation, creativity and collaboration - where managers are not the only ones encouraged to show leadership.
     </p>
     <p>
      They're probably part of a team who are allowed to try things in different ways, who think outside the square about how things are done, and who evolve - and continue to evolve - the company's strategy, policies and procedures.
     </p>
     <p>
      These employees are encouraged to make choices and decisions and express their opinion when they think there is a better way of doing something.
     </p>
     <p>
      They are
      <em>
       expected
      </em>
      to inject their own ideas and creativity into the work they do, and they're part of a culture where it’s normal to be able to question things and engage in two-way dialogue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Managers and leaders should not under-estimate the optimistic effect these types of freedoms can have on someone's outlook, motivation and productivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Perhaps they should consider how they would react if they worked in a regime which dictated every step they took, without consideration for alternative options or ideas.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any of us look back at past working experiences, particularly where we felt "connected" to the job, I’m sure we achieved better results than colleagues who were, or felt, disconnected.
     </p>
     <p>
      To assess the mindset of employees, a first step for business should be to ask if the workplace culture motivates them - and if it does, how?
     </p>
     <p>
      Do they feel encouraged to be creative and innovative in their jobs? Do they think there are genuinely open channels of communication to share ideas and express opinions?
     </p>
     <p>
      It is then possible to learn about how different teams operate and make comparisons, and then assess which teams are producing better results, keeping in mind there is often not a one-size-fits-all approach.
     </p>
     <p>
      Importantly, find out what employees think of the way their team operates, and whether they have any suggestions for improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      If they do have suggestions, ask them why they haven’t put their suggestions forward before. This could potentially give valuable insight into just how open internal communication channels are.
     </p>
     <p>
      You could find that these insights - some of which may be expected - could provide opportunities to consider changes to other areas of your business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Having these conversations will also help build relationships with your staff, which in turn increases their interest in, and commitment, to your business and its success.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such an exercise will also provide feedback on how individual managers operate and the management theories and practices they choose to apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers can then assess how their own management style translates to the output of their team.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only by communicating with people from all levels of the organisation can you gain a clear understanding of the culture and what steps, if any, are needed to ensure the workforce is "happy and engaged".
