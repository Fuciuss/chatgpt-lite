       A fast food shop in Bendigo paid staff as little as $11 an hour because the employer believed it was the ‘going rate’, a Fair Work Ombudsman investigation has found.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employer, who was new to the business, told Fair Work inspectors he was unaware of the Fast Food Industry Award, minimum hourly rates or penalties.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A random audit of the business as part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s national hospitality campaign found that four part-time and casual employees were paid between $11 and $15 an hour.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       They were entitled to a minimum of between $15.74 and $22.48 for normal hours and between $20.77 and $29.67 for work on Sundays.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Collectively, they were short-changed more than $8000, with individual underpayments ranging from $582 to $3004.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has been educated about his workplace obligations and since reimbursed all outstanding entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She says the case study highlights the importance of Goldfields region businesses taking the time to ensure they understand the wage rates applicable to their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Employers also need to be aware that they are not able to enter into agreements which undercut minimum lawful entitlements,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We would encourage anyone establishing or operating a business to seek advice and assistance if they are unclear about their responsibilities.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      “When we find mistakes, our preference is to educate employers about their obligations and assist them to put processes in place to ensure they are compliant in future.”
     </p>

        $8800 for seven casual food and beverage workers in

        </strong>
        who were underpaid their minimum hourly rates, late night and weekend penalty rates, and
