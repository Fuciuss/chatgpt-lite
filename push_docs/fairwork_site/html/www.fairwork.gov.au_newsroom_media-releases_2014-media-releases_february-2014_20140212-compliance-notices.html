      <strong>
       12 February 2014

     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is encouraging employers who have underpaid their staff to rectify any outstanding entitlements promptly, after launching a series of legal proceedings against employers who have allegedly failed to comply with back-payment demands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers must comply with Compliance Notices issued by Fair Work Inspectors, unless they have a reasonable excuse, or make a Court application to challenge the Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of employers in
      <strong>
       Queensland
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Victoria
      </strong>
      are facing civil proceedings in Court for allegedly failing to take action after being issued with Fair Work Ombudsman Compliance Notices late last year:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Brisbane
       </strong>
       information technology consultancy Extrados     Solutions Pty Ltd and the company's sole director Peter Johnson allegedly failed     to back-pay an employee aged in his early 20s a total of $10,813 in wages and     annual leave entitlements. The employee was a Chinese national who was in     Australia on a 457 visa and spoke limited English.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Gold Coast
       </strong>
       -based Absynthe Restaurant Pty Ltd and the     restaurant's owner-operator Meyjitte Boughenout allegedly failed to back-pay an     18-year-old apprentice chef $4195 in wages and annual leave entitlements.
      </li>
      <li>
       Megha Sood – former owner-operator of Anahata Food for Life Indian     restaurant at
       <strong>
        Ocean Grove
       </strong>
       , in
       <strong>
        Victoria
       </strong>
       - and     her company Anahata Naturals Pty Ltd allegedly failed to back-pay $8707 to an     underpaid chef, a Sri Lankan national who was in Australia on a temporary     resident visa.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Melbourne
       </strong>
       orthodontics specialist Daladontics (Vic.) Pty     Ltd allegedly failed to back-pay a total of $9345 to two dental technicians who     had been underpaid wages. One employee is a foreign worker who was in Australia     on a temporary working visa.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      The maximum penalty for a company for failing to comply with a Compliance Notice is $25,500 per breach, while the maximum penalty for individuals is $5100 per breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      In each case, the Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking an additional Court Order for the alleged underpayment to be rectified in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman, Natalie James, said employers - and professionals who provide advice to employers - need to be aware of their obligations under a Compliance Notice issued by inspectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Fair Work inspectors have made extensive efforts to engage with these employers in relation to the alleged underpayments but have not been able to secure sufficient co-operation from the employers," Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work inspectors identify underpayments at thousands of businesses nationally each year and resolve the vast majority of these matters by working co-operatively with employers, guiding them through the back-payment process and assisting them to put systems in place to ensure they pay their staff correctly in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if employers refuse to co-operate, Fair Work inspectors will consider compliance action, including issuing statute-based Compliance Notices, which usually seek action within 28 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      On Compliance Notices, Ms James says: "It is important for employers to understand that the Fair Work Ombudsman is simply seeking to recover wages that should have been paid in the first instance - we are not seeking to be punitive."
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Fair Work Ombudsman is willing to initiate legal proceedings where Compliance Notices are subsequently ignored and the Agency believes it is in the public interest to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      The matters listed above are being heard in the Federal Circuit Court.
     </p>
