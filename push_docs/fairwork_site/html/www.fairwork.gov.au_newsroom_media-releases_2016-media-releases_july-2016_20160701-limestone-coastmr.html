      <strong>
       1 July 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman today released the findings of a recent campaign in South Australia’s
      <strong>
       Limestone Coast
      </strong>
      region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spot checks of 128 employers found:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       98 (77 per cent) were paying their employees correctly,
      </li>
      <li>
       86 (67 per cent) were compliant with record-keeping and pay-slip obligations, and
      </li>
      <li>
       72 (56 per cent) were compliant with all their responsibilities.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Twenty-three businesses were asked to back-pay a total of $23,453 to 49 of their employees who had been short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two employers received Letters of Caution, putting them on notice that future breaches of workplace laws could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses were randomly selected in centres throughout the region, including
      <strong>
       Beachport
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Robe
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Millicent
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       Naracoorte
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Mount Gambier
      </strong>
      .
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Those found to be non-complaint will be re-audited as part of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s ongoing National Compliance Monitoring Campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says some businesses relied on word-of-mouth to determine their workplace practices, such as minimum pay rates and record-keeping.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said a number of businesses mistakenly believed that because they were small business, they were exempt from some requirements, such as issuing pay-slips.
     </p>
     <p>
      She said they were all encouraged to use the free range of tools and resources available at
      <strong>
       www.fairwork.gov.au
      </strong>
      to assist them to understand and comply with their obligations in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Limestone Coast employers must make an effort to ensure they understand the obligations applicable to their workplace, and we can help them,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are committed to creating a culture of compliance in Australian workplaces.”
     </p>
