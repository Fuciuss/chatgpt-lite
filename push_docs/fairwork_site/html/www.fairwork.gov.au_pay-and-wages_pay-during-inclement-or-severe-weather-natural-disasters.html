      Meaning of severe and inclement weather
     </h2>
     <p>
      Inclement weather is when it’s unsafe or unreasonable for an employee to work because of severe weather conditions. Examples include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       heavy rain and storms
      </li>
      <li>
       extreme heat or cold
      </li>
      <li>
       hail or high winds.
      </li>
     </ul>

      Natural disasters

     <p>
      Natural disasters can cause devastation to communities, businesses and individuals. They are more serious and widespread than severe or inclement weather. They can include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       bushfires
      </li>
      <li>
       floods
      </li>
      <li>
       cyclones.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      An employee may have entitlements under their award or agreement that are relevant if they can’t attend work because of an emergency or natural disaster.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a workplace is affected by a natural disaster, employers may need to stand their employees down without pay under the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Act stand down provisions only apply when an employee’s enterprise agreement or employment contract doesn’t have similar stand down provisions. You can check if you’re covered by an agreement using the
      <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/agreements-awards/enterprise-agreements/find-enterprise-agreement">

      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the Fair Work Act, employers can stand down employees without pay where they can’t be usefully employed in certain circumstances. This includes where there is a stoppage of work caused by natural disasters, such as bushfires or floods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers can't stand an employee down just because the business is quiet or there isn't enough work due to bad weather. Find out more about what rules and responsibilities apply at

      Alternatives to standing down employees during a natural disaster
     </h2>
     <p>
      Before standing down an employee under the Fair Work Act, employers should consider all other options available. These can include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       inviting employees to take a period of accrued paid leave (for example, annual leave)
      </li>
      <li>
       <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c3312ae0-b210-49be-9bac-ef2f089ba391" href="/leave/annual-leave/directing-an-employee-to-take-annual-leave" title="Directing an employee to take annual leave">
        requiring employees to take annual leave
       </a>
       if their award or agreement allows it, or if the employee isn’t covered by an award or agreement (and the requirement is reasonable)
      </li>
      <li>
       if there are multiple worksites and not all sites are affected, consider voluntary work sharing arrangements (for example, employees working at sites that aren’t affected by the natural disaster may offer to take paid leave while their position is temporarily filled by someone from an affected site)
      </li>
      <li>
       flexible working arrangements, like working from home.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Any arrangement to change an employee’s working patterns needs to be made in accordance with the Fair Work Act and the requirements in any award or agreement that applies.
