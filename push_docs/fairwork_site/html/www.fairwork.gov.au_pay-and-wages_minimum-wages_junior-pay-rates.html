      When junior pay rates apply
     </h2>
     <p>
      Juniors get paid a percentage of the relevant adult pay rate unless the award, enterprise agreement or other
      <a data-href="/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2034" href="/taxonomy/term/407">
       registered agreement
      </a>
      doesn't have junior rates. If there aren’t junior rates in the award or agreement, then juniors are paid the same as adult employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The percentages that apply are usually based on the employee’s age and increase on their next birthday.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a junior employee isn't covered by an award or agreement, they get a percentage of the National Minimum Wage. See

      Special award rates for juniors working around alcohol
     </h2>
     <p>
      There are 2 common awards that entitle juniors to be paid special rates for selling and serving alcohol. They are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Hospitality Award
      </li>
      <li>
       Restaurant Award.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Juniors covered by these awards who sell or serve alcohol, including as a part of their general waiting duties, have to be paid the adult rate for their classification regardless of their age.
     </p>
     <p>
      Examples of when special rates may apply include when a junior employee:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       sells alcohol to customers in a casino
      </li>
      <li>
       serves alcohol to a seated customer in a restaurant
      </li>
      <li>
       pours alcoholic drinks for service
      </li>
      <li>
       takes an order for alcohol from a customer
      </li>
      <li>
       delivers alcohol (poured by bar staff) to a customer
      </li>
      <li>
       hands an alcoholic beverage to a customer at the register.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
