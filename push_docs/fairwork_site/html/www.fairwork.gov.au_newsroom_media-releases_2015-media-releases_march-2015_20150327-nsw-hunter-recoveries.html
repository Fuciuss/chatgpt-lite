      <strong>

      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Workers in the NSW Hunter region have been back-paid a total of $34,300 in termination entitlements following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In one case, three service technicians at a
       <strong>
        Weston
       </strong>
       business shared in $28,300 back-pay after their employer failed to pay their full lawful entitlements when it made them redundant.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The workers should have received a final pay packet of accrued annual leave entitlements, untaken rostered days off and wages in lieu of notice, but they got nothing.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Their employer said cash-flow problems caused a delay in paying the entitlements but promptly reimbursed all money owed after being contacted by Fair Work inspectors.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In another case, a
       <strong>
        Maitland
       </strong>
       truck driver who had been laid-off was reimbursed $6000 in unpaid redundancy pay, annual leave entitlements and travel allowances after Fair Work inspectors educated his employer about its obligations under workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers must ensure they pay employees their full termination entitlements when an employment relationship ends.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Paying workers correctly on termination of employment is just as important as ensuring they receive their full entitlements throughout their employment,” she says.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Termination entitlements play a vital supporting role for workers while they attempt to pick themselves up, find a new job and get back on their feet.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says while it was disappointing the underpayments occurred, it was pleasing to see both employers co-operate with inspectors and promptly back-pay the employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and helping them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors don't occur again,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The 'Ending Employment' section of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website -
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
       - outlines the entitlements payable in a worker's final pay and includes information on topics such as annual leave and redundancy pay.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is making compliance easier for businesses by continually building on the information available on its website.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Small businesses often don’t have the benefit of in-house human resources and payroll staff, so we place a high priority on developing tools and resources to assist them,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says it is important to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure that those employers doing the right thing are not competitively disadvantaged.
