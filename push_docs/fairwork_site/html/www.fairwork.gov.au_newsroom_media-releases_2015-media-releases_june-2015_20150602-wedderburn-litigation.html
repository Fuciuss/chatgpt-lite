      A Victorian petrol station operator fined more than $120,000 last year for deliberately underpaying staff is again facing legal action – this time for allegedly ignoring an order to pay compensation to an unfairly dismissed employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced proceedings against Wedderburn Petroleum Pty Ltd, which formerly operated a petrol station at 117 High Street,
      <strong>
       Wedderburn
      </strong>
      , north-west of Bendigo.
     </p>
     <p>
      In April last year, the Fair Work Commission ordered the company to pay $5000 compensation to an employee it found had been unfairly dismissed in 2013 after working as a console operator and manager for more than two-and-a-half years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee turned to the Fair Work Ombudsman for help after the compensation was not paid within the required 14 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman made several requests for the company to comply with the Commission’s Orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our inspectors tried to engage with this business to resolve the matter, but were not able to secure co-operation,” says Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legal action comes after Wedderburn Petroleum was last year fined $123,915 in Court for underpaying two other console operators a total of almost $50,000. That fine was also the result of legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says her Agency has an important role to play in enforcing Orders issued by the Fair Work Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Building a culture of compliance with workplace law is important, and employers should be aware that we are prepared to take action where appropriate,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wedderburn Petroleum faces a maximum penalty of $51,000 and the Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking an additional Court Order for the company to pay the outstanding compensation to the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is due in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne today.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is one of a number of Fair Work Ombudsman litigations alleging breaches of a Fair Work Commission Order to pay unfair dismissal compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the one case that has been finalised, Melbourne company World Gym Sunshine Pty Ltd and its director Wayne George Mailing were fined almost $50,000 in September, 2014 for ignoring an order to pay $2200 compensation to a young employee.
