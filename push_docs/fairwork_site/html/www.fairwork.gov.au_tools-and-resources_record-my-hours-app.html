      About the app
     </h2>
     <p>
      Sometimes employers fail to properly keep employee records. This lack of records makes it difficult for an employee, or us, to address concerns about underpayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      We already recommend employees manually record their hours (eg. in a diary) – now we’ve made it easier to do.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees can retrieve this information instantly if an issue about their pay arises and be confident when discussing the issue with their employer. Users can export the data via email to save it somewhere securely, share it with their employer or even with us if they have a question about their entitlements.
     </p>

      How it works
     </h2>
     <p>
      Our app uses the phone’s location services and ‘geofencing’ technology to let users set their workplace location and automatically record when they start and finish work, based on their location.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automatic recording won’t work for all job types, such as people working in places with no mobile or Wi-Fi coverage or people who travel a lot for work. Manual recording has been incorporated to cater for this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees being paid piece rates will find the app useful too. They can:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       record information about their piecework agreement and the amount they picked, packed, pruned or made
      </li>
      <li>
       identify where they worked when they’re not sure of the address.
      </li>
     </ul>
