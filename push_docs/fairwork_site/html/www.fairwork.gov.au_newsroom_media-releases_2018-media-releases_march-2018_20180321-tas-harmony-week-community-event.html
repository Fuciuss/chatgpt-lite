      The Fair Work Ombudsman is collaborating with the Multicultural Council of Tasmania (MCOT) to host a community event aimed at increasing multicultural communities’ awareness of the information and assistance available when it comes to workplace issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here to help – the faces of your Government will be held from 4-6 pm tomorrow (Thursday, 22 March) at the Multicultural Hub in Moonah.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Social Services, Department of Home Affairs, Australian Tax Office, Tasmanian Police, WorkerAssist and WorkSafe Tasmania, as well as the FWO and MCOT, will participate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The event will encourage community members to reach out to relevant government agencies when they need workplace information, advice or assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information relating to workplace rights, taxation, immigration, settlement services and workplace health and safety will be available at the event.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says that her agency is committed to breaking down the barriers that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds may face when seeking workplace assistance.

     <p>
      “We know that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds may find it difficult to access the information they need, or may be reluctant to speak up when they have workplace concerns,” Ms James says.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We want to ensure that everyone working in Australia is aware of their workplace rights and knows where and how to seek assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This event is an excellent opportunity for us to reach out to Tasmania’s growing multicultural community and make sure that they are aware of the wealth of free resources available from us and other government agencies to assist them in the workplace.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says ensuring that workplace information and advice is available and accessible to all those who need it is a focus for her agency.
