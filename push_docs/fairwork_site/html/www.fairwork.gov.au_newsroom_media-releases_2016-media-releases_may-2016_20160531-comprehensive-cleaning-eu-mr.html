       A labour-hire company supplying workers to an abattoir in Western Australia underpaid 27 of its employees, many of them overseas workers, more than $35,000, an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman has found.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Comprehensive Cleaning Pty Ltd supplied workers for Derby Industries Pty Ltd, which operates the Linley Valley Pork abattoir, at
      </span>
      <span>
       Wooroloo
      </span>
      <span>
       , east of
      </span>
      <span>
       Perth
      </span>
      <span>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Many of the underpaid employees were in Australia on 417 working holiday visas from countries including China, Korea, Taiwan and Italy.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       They were engaged on a casual basis to perform meat packing and storage duties at the abattoir.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were short-changed a total of $35,078 between July, 2014 and August, 2015 as a result of Comprehensive Cleaning applying incorrect minimum pay rates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The workers were entitled to be paid according to the terms and conditions of the Meat Industry Award, but the employer mistakenly paid them according to a Derby Industries enterprise agreement, which was not applicable.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The employees were paid flat rates of $18.80 for normal hours and $28.20 for overtime.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under the Meat Industry Award, they were entitled to be paid hourly rates of between $21.09 and $22.10 for normal hours and penalty rates ranging from $25.30 to $35.36 for afternoon, night, weekend, public holiday and overtime work.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Underpayments of individual employees ranged from $180 to $4377.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the underpayments when it investigated a request for assistance lodged by one of the employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Comprehensive Cleaning cooperated with the Fair Work Ombudsman and has agreed to back-pay all employees in full.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The company has entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman aimed at encouraging behavioural change and future compliance with federal workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under the EU, the company will commission a professional audit of its compliance with federal workplace laws, register with the Fair Work Ombudsman’s online tool My Account and develop processes for ensuring future compliance with workplace laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The company will also display a workplace notice detailing its contraventions.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says education is as important as deterrents in achieving compliance with workplace laws.
