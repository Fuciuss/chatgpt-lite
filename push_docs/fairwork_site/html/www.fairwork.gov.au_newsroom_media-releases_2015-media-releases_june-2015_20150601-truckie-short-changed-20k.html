      <strong>
       1 June 2015

     <p>
      A transport company has admitted deliberately underpaying one of its drivers because the only way it could remain competitive was to cut its wages bill.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company told the Fair Work Ombudsman that tenders for new contracts were fiercely competitive and lower prices could only be achieved through lower wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      One driver was not paid for loading or unloading his truck for four years.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the truckie turned to the Fair Work Ombudsman for help, Fair Work inspectors also discovered he had been underpaid his cents-per-kilometre rate and living away from home allowance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The transport company, at
      <strong>
       Midvale
      </strong>
      in Western Australia, co-operated with inspectors and has now back-paid the former employee $20,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer has been put on notice that enforcement action will follow if it breaches workplace laws again.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says employers cannot seek to gain an unfair advantage over their competitors by undercutting minimum wages and entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Businesses must pay their employees for all time worked, including any time spent preparing or packing up at the start and end of a shift,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the matter should serve as a reminder to companies outsourcing work to transport providers to ensure low-cost tenders are not at the expense of underpaid employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      “All parties should undertake due diligence when outsourcing work, particularly to lowest-cost providers, to ensure lower costs are attributable to efficiencies in the business and not the potential underpayment of workers,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 550 of the Fair Work Act provides for accessorial liability - a mechanism through which someone other than the employer who is
      <strong>
       involved
      </strong>
      in a contravention of workplace laws may be held accountable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is increasingly using Section 550 to go up and down the supply chain to scrutinise sub-contracting arrangements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James warned that companies found to be profiting from underpaying workers faced a “very real risk to reputation and impact on their bottom line”.
