      </strong>

      <span>
       Workers at 11 Perth businesses have been back-paid a total of $192,000 following intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The 86 employees worked for businesses in a range of industries at
       <strong>
        Welshpool
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Baldivis
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Wangara
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Claremont
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Kwinana
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Jandakot
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Rockingham
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Fremantle
       </strong>
       .
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The largest back-payment was for 54 apprentices, mostly juniors, who were underpaid almost $58,000 by a group training organisation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       All but eight of the apprentices had missed out Saturday penalty rates for five years because their employer had used an outdated payroll system.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The company also breached workplace laws by deducting course fees and text book costs from the pay packets of some apprentices.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says Fair Work inspectors are confident the mistakes were inadvertent.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       She says it was operating under an old workplace agreement which was no longer valid after the relevant Modern Award was introduced in 2010.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We provided advice to the employer on how to reimburse the apprentices and adopt measures to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A third-year apprentice received the highest back-payment of $3990.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The business has received a formal Letter of Caution about its non-compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>

     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says employers must make an effort to ensure they understand the minimum wages applicable to their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “
      </span>
      <span>
       If employers are paying an adult worker less than $17.29 an hour for normal hours worked, they should check with us immediately,” she said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “Minimum pay rates are non-negotiable and they apply to everyone regardless of nationality and visa status.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
