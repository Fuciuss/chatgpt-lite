     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors will visit the
      <strong>
       Gove Peninsula
      </strong>
      in the Northern Territory next week to educate employers and workers about their workplace rights and responsibilities.

      They will be available over two days to answer questions about pay, conditions and other aspects of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inspectors will visit local businesses on Monday, April 7, handing out information to employers and managers, and staff a "drop-in" information booth on Tuesday April 8.
     </p>
     <p>
      The information booth will operate from 9am and 5pm, in room three at the Training Regional Centre on Chesterfield Circuit in
      <strong>
       Nhulunbuy
      </strong>
      .

      -based Fair Work inspector Jodi Gribben says the aim of the visit is to raise awareness on the Peninsula of national workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      "A big part of the Fair Work Ombudsman's role is to help build knowledge in the community and assist to create fairer workplaces," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Opportunities like this – where we can speak directly to employers and employees and educate them about their obligations and entitlements – are an important way to help achieve that and improve community understanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We encourage anyone in Gove with a question about their workplace rights or obligations to take advantage of the opportunity to come and see us and seek advice."
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman's website – www.fairwork.gov.au – contains a range of tools and resources to assist employers and workers understand and comply with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online tools include an Award Finder and PayCheck Plus to help employers and workers determine the correct pay rates, classifications and minimum entitlements for their industry.
     </p>
