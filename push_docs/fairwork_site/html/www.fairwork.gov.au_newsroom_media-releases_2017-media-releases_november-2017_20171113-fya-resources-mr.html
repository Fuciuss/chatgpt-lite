      Young workers and apprentices will be better equipped to stand up for their rights in the workplace with new resources released today through a partnership between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Foundation for Young Australians.
     </p>
     <p>
      Six new videos available on the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FairWorkGovAu">
       Fair Work Ombudsman’s YouTube channel
      </a>
      address issues commonly experienced by young workers and provide tips for dealing with workplace concerns.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acting Fair Work Ombudsman Kristen Hannah said young workers continued to be an area of concern for the agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Young workers make up only 16 per cent of the Australian workforce however they account for a quarter of all the requests for assistance we receive. This is disproportionately high," Ms Hannah said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We also know that young workers can be more vulnerable as their limited workplace experience can result in a lack of awareness of their rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This is why our agency is focussed on equipping young workers with the knowledge and confidence they need to better understand their entitlements and provide them with information on how to resolve workplace issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are pleased to partner with the Foundation for Young Australians on this initiative," Ms Hannah said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman and the Foundation worked together to explore current issues facing young people in the workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      These findings, combined with data from the Fair Work Ombudsman, informed the topics covered by the new videos, which are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Busting workplace myths
      </li>
      <li>
       Warning signs for young people in the workplace
      </li>

      <li>
       Tips to ensure a smooth transition to a new job.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Ms Hannah encouraged young workers to use the new resources and get in touch with the Fair Work Ombudsman if they needed assistance with problems at work.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Standing up for your rights may make you feel uncomfortable but issues can often be sorted out early with the right support and resources," Ms Hannah said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Often we can resolve problems quickly through early intervention before the problem gets to a point where the employment relationship has ended."
