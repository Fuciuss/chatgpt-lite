      Thousands of restaurants, cafes and catering businesses are joining forces with the Fair Work Ombudsman to improve compliance with federal workplace laws across the hospitality sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Restaurant &amp; Catering Australia (RCA) has signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of its members aimed at creating and maintaining fair workplaces and a level playing field for employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell, who co-signed the MoU with RCA chief executive officer John Hart, has welcomed RCA’s commitment to collaboration and exchange of information, saying it is pleasing to see the two parties work together to promote and achieve workplace compliance.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will provide advice to the RCA about how it can assist its members to meet their workplace obligations as employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The RCA has agreed to apprise the Fair Work Ombudsman of any problems faced by the industry that can act as barriers to compliance. The two parties will work together to devise appropriate solutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “This agreement highlights RCA’s commitment to making compliance with workplace laws a high priority across the hospitality industry,” Mr Campbell said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Through this initiative the RCA is acknowledging there are always opportunities for improvement and is actively seeking out those opportunities for its members.”
     </p>
     <p>
      RCA chief executive officer John Hart says he is pleased to be signing up to the MoU on behalf of his national membership.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We look forward to enhanced consultation from the Fair Work Ombudsman which will no doubt assist our industry,” Mr Hart said.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the agreement, the Fair Work Ombudsman has appointed a dedicated member of staff to work with RCA representatives and respond to industry needs.
