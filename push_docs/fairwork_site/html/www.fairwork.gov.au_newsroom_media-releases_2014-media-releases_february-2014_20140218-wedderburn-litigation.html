      <strong>
       18 February 2014
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal proceedings against the former operator of a petrol station in regional Victoria, alleging two console operators were underpaid a total of almost $50,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Facing Court is Wedderburn Petroleum Pty Ltd, which formerly operated a Caltex petrol station at
      <strong>
       Wedderburn
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The company allegedly underpaid two console operators a total of $47,258 between 2008 and 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      Court documents allege the employees were paid flat hourly rates ranging from $10 to $15.96 for all hours worked, resulting in underpayment of their minimum hourly rate, casual loadings, annual leave entitlements and penalty rates for weekend, public holiday and overtime work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company also allegedly contravened record-keeping and pay slip laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the alleged underpayments when it investigated complaints lodged by the employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employees were allegedly underpaid individual amounts of $25,621 and $21,637.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the company's failure to rectify the alleged underpayments - despite attempts by inspectors to have it resolve the matter voluntarily - was a significant factor in the decision to place the matter before Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged that Wedderburn Petroleum committed multiple breaches of workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company faces penalties of $33,000 to $51,000 per breach.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order for the company to rectify the underpayments in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      A hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on March 26.
