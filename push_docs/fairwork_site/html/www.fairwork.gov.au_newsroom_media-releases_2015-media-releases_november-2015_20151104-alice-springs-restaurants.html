      Dozens of workers at two
      <strong>
       Alice Springs
      </strong>
      restaurants have been back-paid almost $25,000 in wages and entitlements following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Waiters and kitchen staff at one restaurant shared $15,000 in back-pay after being underpaid their minimum hourly rates and penalty rates for weekend and night work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest individual underpayment was $6600.
     </p>
     <p>
      The errors occurred because the business had received incorrect advice from an accountant about how to calculate wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      A second restaurant inadvertently short-changed its employees almost $10,000 because the business applied the incorrect modern award.
     </p>
     <p>
      The wage issues were identified during a pro-active compliance and education campaign by the Fair Work Ombudsman in Alice Springs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, the campaign resulted in more than $70,000 being returned to 216 employees across 22 separate businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the two restaurants acted quickly to rectify the underpayments after they were discovered.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It’s important for employers to be fully aware of the pay rates that apply to their employees, otherwise they can end up facing wages bills they weren’t budgeting for,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tools and resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au include templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The My Account tool allows users to save tailored information such as pay rates and conditions of employment specific to your circumstances.
     </p>

      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws to ensure an even playing field for all businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We are committed to supporting compliant, productive and inclusive Australian workplaces by providing practical advice that is easy to access, understand and apply,” she said.
