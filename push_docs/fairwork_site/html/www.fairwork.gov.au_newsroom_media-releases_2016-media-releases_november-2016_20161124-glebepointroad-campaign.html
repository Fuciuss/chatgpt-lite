      Fair Work Inspectors conducted surprise audits of restaurants, bars and cafes in Glebe Point Road, Sydney, last week to check businesses are complying with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       More than 50 businesses on the strip were audited, following the Fair Work Ombudsman receiving intelligence and allegations from members of the public about non-compliance by employers in the popular cheap eats precinct.

     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The audits involve Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors assessing time-and-wage records to check businesses are paying employees their full lawful entitlements and complying with pay slip and record-keeping laws.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors also spoke with various business operators and their employees.

       The inner-western Sydney suburb of Glebe is popular with city workers, students and backpackers due to the low prices charged in many restaurants, bars and cafes along Glebe Point Road.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says inspectors were keen to assess whether the low prices are due to efficiencies in business practices, as opposed to underpayment of minimum employee entitlements.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “With many businesses in the area operating seven days a weeks, we are focusing on ensuring employees are being paid applicable penalty rates for weekend and night work,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “We also want to be proactive about checking vulnerable employees - including young, migrant and overseas workers – are receiving their full entitlements because we know they can be reluctant to complain and are sometimes not fully aware of their rights.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Assessment of time-and-wages records obtained during the audits is ongoing.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A public report on the results of the campaign will be issued early next year.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Inspectors take a fair and flexible approach to assisting employers to voluntarily rectify non-compliance issues but enforcement action is considered in situations where contraventions are blatant or employers refuse to co-operate.
      </span>

       “If someone suspects something isn’t right, but is unable or unwilling to get directly involved in resolving the issue, they can tell us about it using the tip-off function,’’ Ms James said.
