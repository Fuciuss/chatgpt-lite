      <strong>
       3 February 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A worker at a fast food outlet in
      <strong>
       Newcastle
      </strong>
      , in the Hunter Valley, has been back-paid $15,000 following recent intervention by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employee, in her 20s, worked at the business for 12 years before her employment ended last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, when she failed to receive outstanding entitlements, including accrued annual leave and long service leave, the employee sought assistance from the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the employer co-operated with the Agency and promptly rectified the matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is the responsibility of employers to ensure they pay employees their full termination entitlements when the employment relationship ends,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Paying workers correctly on termination is just as important as ensuring they receive their full entitlements throughout their employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Termination entitlements play a vital supporting role for workers while they attempt to find a new job and get back on their feet.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Our focus is on educating employers about their obligations and helping them to put processes in place to ensure that any errors we find don't occur again.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The Termination section of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website – www.fairwork.gov.au
      <strong>
      </strong>
      –outlines the entitlements payable in a worker's final pay and includes information on topics such as annual leave, long service leave and redundancy pay.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman has also recently recovered back-pay for underpaid workers at two businesses in the
      <strong>
       Port Stephens
      </strong>
      area:
     </p>
     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>
       13 workers at one business were back-paid a total of $9600 after being paid flat rates that were not sufficient to cover their overtime, weekend and public holiday rates, and
      </li>
      <li>
       23 workers at another business were back-paid $7800 after being underpaid minimum shift pay, as well as Sunday and public holiday penalty rates.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="Body">
      Tools and resources available at www.fairwork.gov.au include templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that provides advice about pay, shift, leave and redundancy entitlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers and employees seeking assistance can also visit the website or contact the Fair Work Infoline on
