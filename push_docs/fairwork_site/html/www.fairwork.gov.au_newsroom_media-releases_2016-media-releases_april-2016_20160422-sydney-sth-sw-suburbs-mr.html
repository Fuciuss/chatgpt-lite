      <strong>
       22 April 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A
      <strong>
       Canley Heights
      </strong>
      restaurant has had to back-pay 11 employees almost $65,000 after the Fair Work Ombudsman found the workers were being short-changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employer was paying kitchen hands, cooks and six waiting staff minimum hourly rates for all hours worked.
     </p>
     <p>
      The workers were paid flat rates of between $18.47 and $19.10 an hour, but they were not being paid penalty rates for weekends or public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the
      <em>
       Restaurant Industry Award
      </em>
      , they should have been paid between $23.09 and $28.65 on weekends and up to $47.75 on public holidays.
     </p>
     <p>
      The restaurant was advised of its obligations under the Award after being randomly audited.
     </p>
     <p>
      While it has now ensured it is compliant, the restaurant has received a Letter of Caution from the Fair Work Ombudsman putting it on notice that further contraventions could result in enforcement action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other recent recoveries for employees in Sydney’s south-west include:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       $19,300 for a manufacturing worker in
       <strong>
        Ingleburn
       </strong>
       who did not receive his annual leave entitlements on retirement,
      </li>
      <li>
       $7400 for a male worker at a
       <strong>
        Taren Point
       </strong>
       food business who was not paid overtime for 20 months, and
      </li>
      <li>
       $5100 for a female administration worker in
       <strong>
        Bankstown
       </strong>
       who did not receive entitlements in lieu of notice for termination, annual leave or four days wages.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says employers must make an effort to understand the relevant Award applicable to their individual workplaces.
     </p>
     <p>
      While she was encouraged that the employers co-operated with inspectors and promptly reimbursed employees all money owed, she says the individual cases are a timely reminder for others to self-check their own compliance with workplace laws.
