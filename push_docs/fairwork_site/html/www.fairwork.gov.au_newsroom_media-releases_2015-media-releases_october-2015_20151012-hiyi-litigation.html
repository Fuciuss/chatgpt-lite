      <strong>
       12 October 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The former owner-operators of a
      <strong>
       Melbourne
      </strong>
      7-Eleven store will face court for allegedly underpaying 12 employees more than $84,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman claims the employees, including international students, were sometimes paid flat rates as low as $11 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      One worker was allegedly short-changed more than $16,500 in the 12 months to the end of September last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James today announced legal action against
      <strong>
       Balwyn North
      </strong>
      husband-and-wife Haiyao Xu and Yiran Gu and their company Hiyi Pty Ltd.
     </p>
     <p>
      The couple owned and operated a 7-Eleven store on Royal Parade,
      <strong>
       Parkville
      </strong>
      , until it was sold earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The store was one of 20 outlets targeted by Fair Work inspectors throughout Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane late last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Gu and Mr Xu currently own and operate another 7-Eleven store on the corner of Flinders and Spencer Streets in Melbourne’s CBD.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also under investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the past six years, the Fair Work Ombudsman has recovered more than $600,000 in underpaid wages and entitlements for 182 workers at 7-Eleven outlets.
     </p>
     <p>
      7-Eleven is currently the subject of a national Inquiry by the Fair Work Ombudsman into allegations of systemic underpayments and false record-keeping practices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest litigation is the fourth time the Agency has put a 7-Eleven operator before court since July, 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multiple breaches of workplace laws are being alleged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Gu and Mr Xu face maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per breach and their company up to $51,000 per contravention.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is alleged the 12 casual employees were underpaid a total of $84,047 between September, 2013 and September last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      They were allegedly paid flat rates of between $11 and $17.31 an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, Ms James says they should have received more than $22 for normal hours and up to $37 an hour for some weekend, public holiday, night and overtime shifts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Four of the employees were allegedly underpaid more than $10,000.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms Gu and Mr Xu also allegedly made false entries into the 7-Eleven head office payroll system to make it appear the employees had been paid Award rates and that they had worked less hours than was actually the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James said that while it was pleasing all but $500 of the underpaid wages bill had now been rectified by the employer, legal action was initiated because of the alleged deliberate exploitation of vulnerable overseas workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Agency alleges the store operators were aware of their lawful obligations, but initially chose to ignore them and try to cover up their actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman is seeking Court Orders aimed at ensuring Ms Gu, Mr Xu and Hiyi Pty Ltd comply with workplace laws in future.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Agency is also requesting Orders that it be notified if they plan to sell their current 7-Eleven store or if they engage workers through any other business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says such Orders will help focus the attention of Ms Gu and Mr Xu on the importance of complying with their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on November 17.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says preliminary results from the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Inquiry into 7-Eleven stores is concerning, with contraventions identified at most of the outlets recently targeted for investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last financial year the Agency filed two litigations against 7-Eleven stores and entered into an Enforceable Undertaking with a third.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, Fair Work inspectors issued three Compliance Notices, 13 Infringement Notices (on-the-spot fines) and 16 Letters of Caution to 7-Eleven store operators.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Statement of Findings on the 7-Eleven Inquiry will be issued early next year, including recommendations for the company’s head office.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The findings will be designed to ensure 7-Eleven takes steps to bring about sustainable change in culture in the 7-Eleven network in relation to compliance with workplace laws,” Ms James said.
     </p>
     <p>
      An announcement that former ACCC chairman Professor Allan Fels will head a 7-Eleven panel to review and resolve wage claims is encouraging, but the Fair Work Ombudsman is keen to learn more about how the process will work.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Clearly, we welcome any development which puts money which should have been paid in the first place back into the hands of workers,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “I am pleased that 7-Eleven head office now seems willing to take steps to address any systemic issues underpinning the wages and conditions breaches we have been finding at 7-Eleven stores for some time now.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman is committed to continuing its own, independent investigations to ensure 7-Eleven takes the necessary steps to ensure ongoing compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      “And it is important that there is transparency and accountability to the Fair Work Ombudsman and the community around the steps taken by 7-Eleven head office to bring about sustainable change in culture among its franchisees,” she said.

      Background
     </h2>
     <p>
      In 2011, the former operators of two 7-Eleven stores in Melbourne and Geelong - Bosen Pty Ltd and its directors Hao Chen and Zue Jing - were fined a total of $150,000 and ordered to back-pay six international students more than $89,000 (see:
      <a href="/about-us/news-and-media-releases/archived-media-releases/2011-media-releases/april-2011/20110427-bosen">
       Convenience store operators fined $150,000 for underpaying international students
      </a>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      In August this year, the former operator of a 7-Eleven store in Brisbane, Mubin Ul Haider, was fined $6970 after underpaying an international students more than $21,000 and refusing to co-operate with the Fair Work Ombudsman (see:
      <a href="/about-us/news-and-media-releases/archived-media-releases/2015-media-releases/august-2015/20150804-haider-penalty">
       7-Eleven operator fined over underpayment
      </a>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      In June this year, the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced proceedings against the operators of a 7-Eleven store at Blacktown, in
      <strong>
       Sydney
      </strong>
      – Harmandeep Singh Sarkaria and his company Amritsaria Four Pty Ltd – for allegedly underpaying two migrant employees almost $50,000 and creating erroneous records for the workers. The matter is still before the Court (see:

      </a>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman also entered into an Enforceable Undertaking earlier this year with the operators of a 7-Eleven store in the Melbourne CBD – Kumar Sandarakumar and his company PSP International Trading Pty Ltd - after staff were underpaid more than $30,000 and employment records were doctored (see:
