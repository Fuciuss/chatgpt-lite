     <p>
      Following yesterday afternoon’s Full Federal Court decision, the Road Safety Remuneration Order 2016 has commenced operation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman’s role includes providing education, advice and assistance to those affected by the 2016 Order and to monitor compliance with the 2016 Order.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The 2016 Order prescribes rates of pay for contractor drivers for the first time.  We recognise that this cohort has previously not been subject to regulation of this nature.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman will continue to consult broadly with stakeholders about the interpretation and application of the 2016 Order.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With respect to compliance with the 2016 Order, our approach will be fair and flexible and achieved through a mix of guidance, advice, education and common sense.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We will not take a punitive approach to those who act in good faith with the 2016 Order.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We have a range of online resources available to assist people understand and comply with the 2016 Order.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anyone seeking information and advice about the 2016 Order can call the Fair Work Infoline on
