      <strong>
       03 February 2015
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A South Australian man took a sales position at a residential property company with an advertised potential salary of $120,000 or more - but quit 10 months later after earning less than $7000.
     </p>
     <p>
      A second man also took a job believing he could earn more than $70,000 a year – but quit six months later after being paid nothing at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company – Adelaide-based Longridge Group Pty Ltd, which designs, sells and builds new residential homes – has now been fined a total of $29,790 in the Federal Circuit Court in Adelaide.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty follows legal action by the Fair Work Ombudsman.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company admitted it had inadvertently breached workplace laws by paying the two employees on a commission-only basis in 2011-12.
     </p>
     <p>
      This resulted in Longridge underpaying the pair a total of $24,956 in minimum wages and entitlements they were entitled to under the
      <em>
       Miscellaneous Award 2010
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the underpaid employees, aged 59, had an MBA in sales and marketing and 22-years’ experience in commercial sales and marketing.
     </p>
     <p>
      He secured the sales position with Longridge Group after responding to a newspaper advertisement that promised ‘
      <em>
       an earning structure that doesn’t limit earnings – 120k++
      </em>
      ’.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, he quit 10 months later after signing up only four customers to building contracts, earning commissions totalling $6704.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, he should have been paid $20,013.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second salesman, 32, had qualifications in real estate and a certificate in building and construction, as well as some experience as a sales consultant in the building industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      He gave evidence that he understood he would be able to earn between $70,000 and $80,000 a year from selling Longridge homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      He quit after six months after not being able to sell any homes and not being paid anything at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      He should have been paid minimum wages and entitlements totaling $11,647.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman investigated after the workers complained.
     </p>
     <p>
      When Longridge refused to back-pay the workers in full, legal proceedings commenced.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the company later admitted in Court that it had inadvertently breached workplace laws by failing to pay the employees’ minimum wages and entitlements. The company subsequently back-paid the workers in full.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Stewart Brown said the underpayments were significant for both employees and forced them to depend financially on their respective wives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Brown said the employees provided valuable services for the Longridge Group for which they were not remunerated.
     </p>
     <p>
      “They manned (Longridge’s) display villages, they fielded inquiries from the general public, they acted as the public face of Longridge,” Judge Brown said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The gentlemen in question worked for periods of months, rather than weeks or days, before they each threw in the towel (with Longridge) and sought alternative employment.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Brown found that Longridge was not aware that the
      <em>
       Miscellaneous Award
      </em>
      applied to the employees, but that the company must have been aware that “each was falling far short of the average level of wages enjoyed by other sales consultants”.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The objective of the modern award system is that all employees should have available to them an appropriate safety net of minimum employment standards,” he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The penalty must be sufficient to convey the message to other employers of the importance of adherence to applicable modern awards in their payment of employees.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Judge Brown also found that Longridge’s failure to keep proper employment records was a serious breach, noting that the company conceded there was no reasonable excuse for it.
     </p>
     <p>
      “The keeping of proper and accurate employment records enables regulators, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman, to carry out their statutory obligations effectively,” Judge Brown said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the Court penalty illustrates the importance of employers taking proactive steps to understand the laws applicable to their workplace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Agency is working hard to build a culture of compliance with workplace laws in Australia with the objective of supporting compliant, productive and inclusive workplaces.
