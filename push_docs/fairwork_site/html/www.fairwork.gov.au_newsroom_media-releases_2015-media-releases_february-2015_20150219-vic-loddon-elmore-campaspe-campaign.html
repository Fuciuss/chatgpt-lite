       Fair Work inspectors will contact up to 250 businesses at locations including
       <strong>
        Elmore
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Kyabram
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Leitchville
       </strong>
       ,

       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>

       Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the aim is to ensure employers are aware of their workplace responsibilities and how her Agency can assist businesses to access, understand and apply information to build a culture of compliance.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       “It’s important we check that workers are receiving their correct entitlements, but we also want to be pro-active about ensuring employers in these regions understand their obligations,” Ms James said.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The campaign will focus on businesses from a range of sectors, including fast food, retail, accommodation and the dairy industry.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The dairy industry is a significant employer in the
      </span>
      <span>
       Campaspe shire and consistently
      </span>
      <span>
       generates requests for assistance from employees.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fair Work inspectors will check employers are paying employees the correct minimum hourly rates, penalty rates, allowances and loadings and are providing meal breaks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Compliance with record-keeping and pay slip obligations will also be monitored.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Ms James says inspectors will work with employers in the region to rectify any non-compliance issues and put processes in place to ensure they get it right in the future.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       They will also inform employers about the range of free tools and resources available on the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website at
       <strong>
        www.fairwork.gov.au
       </strong>
       to assist them to understand and comply with their obligations.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Online tools include calculators to determine the correct wages for employees, templates for time-and-wages records, an online learning centre and My Account, which enables employers and employees to save information on pay and conditions for their workplace.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
