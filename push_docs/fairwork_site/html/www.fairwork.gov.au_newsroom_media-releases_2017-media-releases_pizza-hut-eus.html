       Two franchise operators in Sydney and one at Mango Hill, Queensland, have signed Enforceable Undertakings with the Fair Work Ombudsman as a result of workplace breaches identified during the investigation into Pizza Hut franchisee delivery drivers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       All three had paid their workers on a per-delivery basis at rates ranging between $5.70 and $8 and all three employers failed to issue pay slips and keep proper records.

     <p>
      <span>
       Romaro Holdings Pty Ltd, trading as Pizza Hut Penrith, was found to have underpaid four male drivers a total $3284 when paying a rate of just $5.70 per delivery.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Enforceable undertaking requires Romaro Holdings to repay all staff impacted by underpayments within 28 days and to provide this staff with a formal apology.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The terms of the Enforceable undertaking also require the franchisee to register for a FWO MyAccount, to provide information on workplace rights to all staff, to ensure that all staff are properly engaged as employees rather than independent contractors and to provide the FWO with written notice of the systems and processes that have been implemented to ensure compliance.

     </h2>
     <p>
      <span>
       Surmin Pty Ltd, operating a Pizza Hut outlet on Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills, incorrectly classified three male delivery drivers from India, as independent contractors. Record-keeping and pay-slip laws were also contravened.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The enforceable undertaking requires the franchisee to correctly engage delivery drivers as employees rather than independent contractors and to issue an apology to the workers impacted by the misclassification.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The terms of the enforceable undertaking also require the franchisee to provide materials to staff informing them of their workplace rights and to provide the FWO with written notice of the processes and systems adopted to address non-compliance.
