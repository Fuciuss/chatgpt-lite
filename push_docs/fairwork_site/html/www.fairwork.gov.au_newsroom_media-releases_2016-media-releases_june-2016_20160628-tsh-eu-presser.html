      <strong>
       28 June 2016
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of international students and working holiday visa-holders are among farm workers in regional Queensland who have been underpaid thousands of dollars.
     </p>
     <p>
      The overseas workers - from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Africa, France, Germany, Italy and the UK – were employed by labour contractor Team Search Harvesting.
     </p>
     <p>
      They planted, weeded and picked lettuce on Story Fresh farms in the
      <strong>
       Darling Downs
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       Lockyer Valley
      </strong>
      in South-East Queensland.
     </p>
     <p>
      Story Fresh is a family-owned vegetable farming and processing business which supplies shredded lettuce to fast-food outlets in eastern Australia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fast-food outlets using Story Fresh shredded lettuce include Subway and Hungry Jacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Story Fresh previously outsourced part of its workforce requirement to Team Search Harvesting, but has now severed its ties with the labour contractor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says Story Fresh paid a contract price that was high enough for Team Search Harvesting to ensure its employees received minimum wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says Team Search Harvesting paid its employees under a piece-rate agreement to pick lettuce, but the agreements were invalid, as they were not signed – and a flat rate of $15 for weeding and planting.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fair Work Ombudsman discovered the underpayment when it investigated a request for assistance from a former employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The worker was found to have been short-changed more than $3200.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further inquiries by Fair Work inspectors as part of the Agency’s national Harvest Trail Inquiry revealed over 100 other workers had been underpaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      A total of 107 casual employees were collectively short-changed a total of $15,892 between January 1, 2014 to July 30, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      They included 49 international students, 35 overseas workers on the 417 working holiday visa and 11 overseas workers on spousal visas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Instead of the flat $15 an hour they were paid, they should have received a casual hourly rate for normal work of $20.40 from July 1, 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      This increased to $21.09 from July 1, 2014 and $21.61 from July 1, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      Team Search Harvesting also made unlawful deductions from employee wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company took out $5 to cover the return daily bus trip to and from the properties the employee were working on without getting their written permission.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also contravened workplace laws relating to record-keeping, issuing of pay-slips and providing the Fair Work Information Statement to new employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says the Fair Work Ombudsman has requested Team Search Harvesting partners Lai Yoong Ching and Swee Cheng Khong to sign an Enforceable Undertaking.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is aimed at encouraging behavioural change and future compliance with federal workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James says fruit and vegetable growers rely heavily on seasonal labour – and these workers are often visa-holders from non-English speaking backgrounds who may be unaware of their workplace rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Outsourcing is a legitimate business arrangement – but in my experience, in highly competitive markets for low-skilled work, it also increases the risk that workers will be underpaid, sometimes quite deliberately,” she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms James reminded employers using piece rates that they must have written agreements in place signed by the employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      “In the absence of a piece-rate agreement, workers are required to be paid hourly rates of pay according to the Horticulture Award 2010,” she says.
     </p>
     <p>
      Team Search Harvesting has agreed to implement a range of measures to ensure future compliance with their workplace obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the agreement, the company will rectify all underpayments by March next year, introduce systems and processes to meet workplace requirements and send a letter of apology to affected employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      It has fully reimbursed the employee who lodged a request for assistance and so far repaid $550 to the remaining underpaid workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other requirements include placing a notice in the
      <em>
       Toowoomba Chronicle
      </em>
      about the contraventions, training staff in senior human resources, payroll and recruitment roles and engaging an external professional to audit the company’s compliance with workplace laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company will also register with My Account and distribute to new employees a Fair Work Information Statement and information about the Fair Work Ombudsman, employer records and pay-slip obligations.
     </p>
