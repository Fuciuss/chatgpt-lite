(3A)	Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) may prescribe different kinds of periods for the purposes of different provisions of this Act (other than provisions to which subsection (4) applies). If they do so, subsection (3) applies accordingly.Meaning for Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 22	(4)	For the purposes of Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 22:	(a)	a period of service by a national system employee with his or her national system employer is a period during which the employee is employed by the employer, but does not include:	(i)	any period of unauthorised absence; or	(ii)	any other period of a kind prescribed by the regulations; and	(b)	a period referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) does not break a national system employee’s continuous service with his or her national system employer, but does not count towards the length of the employee’s continuous service; and	(c)	subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply.Note:	Divisions 4 and 5, and Subdivision A of Division 11, of Part 22 deal, respectively, with requests for flexible working arrangements, parental leave and related entitlements, and notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice.

(8)	A transfer of employment:	(a)	is a transfer of employment between associated entities if paragraph (7)(a) applies; and	(b)	is a transfer of employment between nonassociated entities if paragraph (7)(b) applies.23  Meaning of small business employer	(1)	A national system employer is a small business employer at a particular time if the employer employs fewer than 15 employees at that time.	(2)	For the purpose of calculating the number of employees employed by the employer at a particular time:	(a)	subject to paragraph (b), all employees employed by the employer at that time are to be counted; and	(b)	a casual employee is not to be counted unless, at that time, he or she has been employed by the employer on a regular and systematic basis.	(3)	For the purpose of calculating the number of employees employed by the employer at a particular time, associated entities are taken to be one entity.	(4)	To avoid doubt, in determining whether a national system employer is a small business employer at a particular time in relation to the dismissal of an employee, or termination of an employee’s employment, the employees that are to be counted include (subject to paragraph (2)(b)):	(a)	the employee who is being dismissed or whose employment is being terminated; and	(b)	any other employee of the employer who is also being dismissed or whose employment is also being terminated.23A  Terms relating to superannuation	(1)	MySuper product has the meaning given by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.

(3)	A corporate MySuper product is a MySuper product that is offered by a superannuation fund that:	(a)	is a standard employersponsored fund (within the meaning of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993); and	(b)	is not a public offer superannuation fund (within the meaning of that Act); and	(c)	has:	(i)	one standard employersponsor (within the meaning of that Act); or	(ii)	2 or more standard employersponsors (within the meaning of that Act) that are associates of each other for the purposes of that Act.	(4)	A reference in this Act to a superannuation fund doing a thing in relation to a matter (for example, offering a MySuper product or making an application or submission) is a reference to the RSE licensee (within the meaning of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993) of the fund doing that thing."

The main terms and conditions come from the National Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations.The National Employment Standards (Part 22) are minimum terms and conditions that apply to all national system employees.A modern award (see Part 23), an enterprise agreement (see Part 24) or a workplace determination (see Part 25) provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom the award, agreement or determination applies. Only one of those instruments can apply to an employee at a particular time.Division 2 has the provisions to enforce the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements. It also sets out when a modern award or enterprise agreement applies to a person and the significance of that for this Act.	Note:	In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279). For the rules about workplace determinations, see Part 25.Division 3 deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.42  Meanings of employee and employer		In this Part, employee means a national system employee, and employer means a national system employer.Note:	See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances)."

(3)	The National Employment Standards have effect subject to terms included in a modern award or enterprise agreement as referred to in subsection (2).Note:	See also the note to section 63 (which deals with the effect of averaging arrangements).Ancillary and supplementary terms may be included	(4)	A modern award or enterprise agreement may also include the following kinds of terms:	(a)	terms that are ancillary or incidental to the operation of an entitlement of an employee under the National Employment Standards;	(b)	terms that supplement the National Employment Standards;but only to the extent that the effect of those terms is not detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared to the National Employment Standards.Note 1:	Ancillary or incidental terms permitted by paragraph (a) include (for example) terms:(a)	under which, instead of taking paid annual leave at the rate of pay required by section 90, an employee may take twice as much leave at half that rate of pay; or(b)	that specify when payment under section 90 for paid annual leave must be made.Note 2:	Supplementary terms permitted by paragraph (b) include (for example) terms:(a)	that increase the amount of paid annual leave to which an employee is entitled beyond the number of weeks that applies under section 87; or(b)	that provide for an employee to be paid for taking a period of paid annual leave or paid/personal carer’s leave at a rate of pay that is higher than the employee’s base rate of pay (which is the rate required by sections 90 and 99).Note 3:	Terms that would not be permitted by paragraph (a) or (b) include (for example) terms requiring an employee to give more notice of the taking of unpaid parental leave than is required by section 74. agreements may include terms that have the same effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards	(5)	An enterprise agreement may include terms that have the same (or substantially the same) effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards, whether or not ancillary or supplementary terms are included as referred to in subsection (4).Effect of terms that give an employee the same entitlement as under the National Employment Standards	(6)	To avoid doubt, if a modern award includes terms permitted by subsection (4), or an enterprise agreement includes terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5), then, to the extent that the terms give an employee an entitlement (the award or agreement entitlement) that is the same as an entitlement (the NES entitlement) of the employee under the National Employment Standards:	(a)	those terms operate in parallel with the employee’s NES entitlement, but not so as to give the employee a double benefit; and	(b)	the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to the NES entitlement apply, as a minimum standard, to the award or agreement entitlement.Note:	For example, if the award or agreement entitlement is to 6 weeks of paid annual leave per year, the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to the accrual and taking of paid annual leave will apply, as a minimum standard, to 4 weeks of that leave.Terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5) do not contravene subsection (1)	(7)	To the extent that a term of a modern award or enterprise agreement is permitted by subsection (4) or (5), the term does not contravene subsection (1).Note:	A term of a modern award has no effect to the extent that it contravenes this section (see section 56).

(2)	Despite section 57, the designated outworker terms of the modern award apply at that time to the following:	(a)	the employer;	(b)	each employee who is both:	(i)	a person to whom the enterprise agreement applies; and	(ii)	a person who is covered by the modern award;	(c)	each employee organisation that is covered by the modern award.

The notice must specify the new end date for the leave.	(4)	Only one extension is permitted under subsection (3).Further extensions by agreement with employer	(5)	If the employer agrees, the employee may further extend the period of unpaid parental leave one or more times.No entitlement to extension beyond available parental leave period	(6)	The employee is not entitled under this section to extend the period of unpaid parental leave beyond the employee’s available parental leave period.76  Extending period of unpaid parental leave—extending for up to 12 months beyond available parental leave periodEmployee may request further period of leave	(1)	An employee who takes unpaid parental leave for his or her available parental leave period may request his or her employer to agree to an extension of unpaid parental leave for the employee for a further period of up to 12 months immediately following the end of the available parental leave period.Note:	Extended periods of unpaid parental leave can include keeping in touch days on which an employee performs work (see section 79A).Making the request	(2)	The request must be in writing, and must be given to the employer at least 4 weeks before the end of the available parental leave period.Agreeing to the requested extension	(3)	The employer must give the employee a written response to the request stating whether the employer grants or refuses the request.

(5)	If the employer refuses the request, the written response under subsection (3) must include details of the reasons for the refusal.Discussion	(5A)	The employer must not refuse the request unless the employer has given the employee a reasonable opportunity to discuss the request.Special rules for employee couples	(6)	The following paragraphs apply in relation to a member of an employee couple extending a period of unpaid parental leave in relation to a child under this section:	(a)	the request must specify any amount of unpaid parental leave that the other member of the employee couple has taken, or will have taken, in relation to the child before the extension starts;	(b)	the period of the extension cannot exceed 12 months, less any period of unpaid parental leave that the other member of the employee couple has taken, or will have taken, in relation to the child before the extension starts;	(c)	the amount of unpaid parental leave to which the other member of the employee couple is entitled under section 70 in relation to the child is reduced by the period of the extension.No extension beyond 24 months after birth or placement	(7)	Despite any other provision of this Division, the employee is not entitled to extend the period of unpaid parental leave beyond 24 months after the date of birth or day of placement of the child.77  Reducing period of unpaid parental leave		If the employer agrees, an employee whose period of unpaid parental leave has started may reduce the period of unpaid parental leave he or she takes.77A  Pregnancy ends (other than by birth of a living child) or child born alive diesApplication of this section	(1)	This section applies to unpaid parental leave, if:	(a)	the leave is birthrelated leave; and	(b)	either:	(i)	the pregnancy ends other than by the child being born alive; or	(ii)	the child dies after being born.Cancellation of leave	(2)	Before the leave starts:	(a)	the employee may give the employer written notice cancelling the leave; or	(b)	the employer may give the employee written notice cancelling the leave.Example:	Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if:(a)	the child dies after being born; and(b)	the employee is the female employee who gave birth to the child.	This is because in this case the leave must not start later than the date of birth of the child (see subsection 71(3)).	(3)	If the employee or employer does so, the employee is not entitled to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child.Note:	If the employee is the female employee who was pregnant with the child and the employee is not fit for work, she may be entitled to:(a)	paid personal leave under Subdivision A of Division 7; or(b)	unpaid special maternity leave under section 80.Return to work	(4)	The employee may give the employer written notice that the employee wishes to return to work:	(a)	after the start of the period of leave, but before its end; and	(b)	within 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice.	(5)	The employer:	(a)	may give the employee written notice requiring the employee to return to work on a specified day; and	(b)	must do so if the employee gives the employer written notice under subsection (4);unless the leave has not started and the employer cancels it under subsection (2).	(6)	The specified day must be after the start of the period of leave, and:	(a)	if subsection (4) applies—within 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice under that subsection; or	(b)	otherwise—at least 6 weeks after the notice is given to the employee under subsection (5).	(7)	The employee’s entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends immediately before the specified day.Interaction with section 77	(8)	This section does not limit section 77 (which deals with the employee ending the period of unpaid parental leave with the agreement of the employer).78  Employee who ceases to have responsibility for care of child	(1)	This section applies to an employee who has taken unpaid parental leave in relation to a child if the employee ceases to have any responsibility for the care of the child.	(1A)	However, this section does not apply if section 77A applies to the unpaid parental leave (because the unpaid parental leave is birthrelated leave and either the pregnancy ends other than by the child being born alive or the child dies after being born).	(2)	The employer may give the employee written notice requiring the employee to return to work on a specified day.	(3)	The specified day:	(a)	must be at least 4 weeks after the notice is given to the employee; and	(b)	if the leave is birthrelated leave taken by a female employee who has given birth—must not be earlier than 6 weeks after the date of birth of the child.	(4)	The employee’s entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends immediately before the specified day.79  Interaction with paid leave	(1)	This Subdivision (except for subsections (2) and (3)) does not prevent an employee from taking any other kind of paid leave while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave. If the employee does so, the taking of that other paid leave does not break the continuity of the period of unpaid parental leave.Note:	For example, if the employee has paid annual leave available, he or she may (with the employer’s agreement) take some or all of that paid annual leave at the same time as the unpaid parental leave.	(2)	An employee is not entitled to take paid personal/carer’s leave or compassionate leave while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave.

(3)	Applicable awardderived long service leave terms, in relation to an employee, are:	(a)	terms of an award, or a State reference transitional award, that (disregarding the effect of any instrument of a kind referred to in subsection (2)):	(i)	would have applied to the employee at the test time (see subsection (3A)) if the employee had, at that time, been in his or her current circumstances of employment; and	(ii)	would have entitled the employee to long service leave; and	(b)	any terms of the award, or the State reference transitional award, that are ancillary or incidental to the terms referred to in paragraph (a).

(2)	The replacement agreement may include terms to the effect that an employee’s service with the employer during a specified period (the excluded period) (being some or all of the period when the first instrument applied to the employee) does not count as service for the purpose of determining whether the employee is qualified for long service leave, or the amount of long service leave to which the employee is entitled, under this Division or under a law of a State or Territory.	(3)	If the replacement agreement includes terms as permitted by subsection (2), the excluded period does not count, and never again counts, as service for the purpose of determining whether the employee is qualified for long service leave, or the amount of long service leave to which the employee is entitled, under this Division or under a law of a State or Territory, unless a later agreement provides otherwise.

Fair Work Act 2009 Volume 1,Part 2-3 - Modern awards,Division 1 - Introduction,"132  Guide to this PartThis Part provides for the FWC to make, vary and revoke modern awards. Modern awards may set minimum terms and conditions for national system employees in particular industries or occupations. Modern awards can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards (see Part 21).Division 2 provides for the modern awards objective. This requires the FWC to ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account certain social and economic factors. Division 2 also contains special provisions about modern award minimum wages.Division 3 deals with the terms of modern awards.Division 4 provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of modern awards (other than in relation to default fund terms of modern awards).Division 4A provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of default fund terms of modern awards.It also sets out the process for making the Schedule of Approved Employer MySuper products in a 4 yearly review, and amending the schedule after it is made to include other employer MySuper products. If an employer MySuper product is on the schedule, an employer covered by a modern award can make contributions, for the benefit of a default fund employee, to a superannuation fund that offers the product (see subsection 149D(1A)).Division 5 provides for the FWC to exercise modern award powers outside the system of 4 yearly reviews in certain circumstances.Division 6 contains some general provisions relating to modern award powers.Division 7 contains additional provisions relating to modern enterprise awards.Division 8 contains additional provisions relating to State reference public sector modern awards.The obligation to comply with a modern award is in section 45 (in Part 21).In relation to minimum wages in modern awards, the FWC has powers both under this Part and under Part 26 (which deals with minimum wages). The following is a summary of the FWC’s powers under the 2 Parts:(a)	the initial making of a modern award setting modern award minimum wages can only occur under this Part;(b)	the main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 26;(c)	modern award minimum wages can also be varied under this Part, but only for work value reasons or in other limited circumstances;(d)	modern award minimum wages can be set (otherwise than in the initial making of a modern award) or revoked either under this Part or in annual wage reviews under Part 26.133  Meanings of employee and employer		In this Part, employee means a national system employee, and employer means a national system employer.Note:	See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances)."
Fair Work Act 2009 Volume 1,Part 2-3 - Modern awards,Division 2 - Overarching provisions,"134  The modern awards objectiveWhat is the modern awards objective?	(1)	The FWC must ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account:	(a)	relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and	(b)	the need to encourage collective bargaining; and	(c)	the need to promote social inclusion through increased workforce participation; and	(d)	the need to promote flexible modern work practices and the efficient and productive performance of work; and	(da)	the need to provide additional remuneration for:	(i)	employees working overtime; or	(ii)	employees working unsocial, irregular or unpredictable hours; or	(iii)	employees working on weekends or public holidays; or	(iv)	employees working shifts; and	(e)	the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value; and	(f)	the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on business, including on productivity, employment costs and the regulatory burden; and	(g)	the need to ensure a simple, easy to understand, stable and sustainable modern award system for Australia that avoids unnecessary overlap of modern awards; and	(h)	the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on employment growth, inflation and the sustainability, performance and competitiveness of the national economy.This is the modern awards objective.When does the modern awards objective apply?	(2)	The modern awards objective applies to the performance or exercise of the FWC’s modern award powers, which are:	(a)	the FWC’s functions or powers under this Part; and	(b)	the FWC’s functions or powers under Part 26, so far as they relate to modern award minimum wages.Note:	The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the minimum wages objective also applies (see section 284).135  Special provisions relating to modern award minimum wages	(1)	Modern award minimum wages cannot be varied under this Part except as follows:	(a)	modern award minimum wages can be varied if the FWC is satisfied that the variation is justified by work value reasons (see subsections 156(3) and 157(2));	(b)	modern award minimum wages can be varied under section 160 (which deals with variation to remove ambiguities or correct errors) or section 161 (which deals with variation on referral by the Australian Human Rights Commission).Note 1:	The main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 26. Modern award minimum wages can also be set or revoked in annual wage reviews.Note 2:	For the meanings of modern award minimum wages, and setting and varying such wages, see section 284.	(2)	In exercising its powers under this Part to set, vary or revoke modern award minimum wages, the FWC must take into account the rate of the national minimum wage as currently set in a national minimum wage order."

An enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.Division 2 deals with the making of enterprise agreements about permitted matters. An enterprise agreement (including a greenfields agreement) may be a singleenterprise agreement or a multienterprise agreement.Division 3 deals with the right of employees to be represented by a bargaining representative during bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. It also sets out the persons who are bargaining representatives for such agreements.Subdivision A of Division 4 deals with the approval of proposed enterprise agreements by employees and sets out when an enterprise agreement is made.Subdivision B of Division 4 deals with the approval of enterprise agreements by the FWC. The remaining Subdivisions of the Division deal with certain approval requirements, including in relation to genuine agreement by employees and the better off overall test.Division 5 deals with the mandatory terms of enterprise agreements relating to individual flexibility arrangements and consultation requirements. Division 6 deals with the base rate of pay under an enterprise agreement.Division 7 deals with the variation and termination of enterprise agreements.Division 8 provides for the FWC to facilitate bargaining by making bargaining orders, serious breach declarations, majority support determinations and scope orders.

It also permits the FWC to assist the bargaining representatives for such agreements.Division 10 deals with single interest employer authorisations. The effect of such an authorisation is that the employers specified in the authorisation are single interest employers in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement.Division 11 deals with other matters relating to enterprise agreements.170  Meanings of employee and employer		In this Part, employee means a national system employee, and employer means a national system employer.Note:	See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).171  Objects of this Part		The objects of this Part are:	(a)	to provide a simple, flexible and fair framework that enables collective bargaining in good faith, particularly at the enterprise level, for enterprise agreements that deliver productivity benefits; and	(b)	to enable the FWC to facilitate good faith bargaining and the making of enterprise agreements, including through:	(i)	making bargaining orders; and	(ii)	dealing with disputes where the bargaining representatives request assistance; and	(iii)	ensuring that applications to the FWC for approval of enterprise agreements are dealt with without delay."

Fair Work Act 2009 Volume 1,Part 2-6 - Minimum wages,Division 1 - Introduction,"282  Guide to this PartThis Part provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel) to set and vary minimum wages for national system employees. For employees covered by modern awards, minimum wages are specified in the modern award. For award/agreement free employees, minimum wages are specified in the national minimum wage order.Division 2 provides for the minimum wages objective. This requires the FWC to establish and maintain a safety net of fair minimum wages, taking into account certain social and economic factors.Division 3 provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel) to conduct annual wage reviews. In an annual wage review, the FWC may set or vary minimum wages in modern awards, and must make a national minimum wage order. Minimum wages in modern awards can also be set, or varied (in limited circumstances), under Part 23 (which deals with modern awards).Division 4 provides for national minimum wage orders and requires employers to comply with them. The orders set the national minimum wage, as well as special national minimum wages for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability. The orders also set the casual loading for award/agreement free employees.National minimum wages and special national minimum wages apply to award/agreement free employees. However, they are also relevant to other employees as follows:(a)	in setting or varying modern award minimum wages, the FWC must take the national minimum wage into account (see subsection 135(2) (in Part 23) and subsection 285(3) (in this Part));(b)	for an employee who is not covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee’s base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the relevant national minimum wage or special national minimum wage (see subsection 206(3) (in Part 24)).For an employee who is covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee’s base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the base rate of pay that would have been payable to the employee if the award applied (see subsection 206(1) (in Part 24)).283  Meanings of employee and employer		In this Part, employee means a national system employee, and employer means a national system employer.Note:	See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances)."

(2)	The minimum wages objective applies to the performance or exercise of:	(a)	the FWC’s functions or powers under this Part; and	(b)	the FWC’s functions or powers under Part 23, so far as they relate to setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages.Note:	The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the modern awards objective also applies (see section 134).Meaning of modern award minimum wages	(3)	Modern award minimum wages are the rates of minimum wages in modern awards, including:	(a)	wage rates for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability; and	(b)	casual loadings; and	(c)	piece rates.Meaning of setting and varying modern award minimum wages	(4)	Setting modern award minimum wages is the initial setting of one or more new modern award minimum wages in a modern award, either in the award as originally made or by a later variation of the award. Varying modern award minimum wages is varying the current rate of one or more modern award minimum wages."

Fair Work Act 2009 Volume 1,Part 3-3 - Industrial action,Division 8 - Protected action ballots,"Subdivision A—Introduction435  Guide to this DivisionThis Division establishes the process that will allow employees to choose, by means of a fair and democratic secret ballot, whether to authorise protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement.Subdivision B provides for the FWC to make a protected action ballot order, on application by a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement, requiring a protected action ballot to be conducted.Subdivision C deals with the conduct of a protected action ballot.Subdivision D deals with the effect of a protected action ballot.Subdivision E deals with compliance matters in relation to a protected action ballot.Subdivision F deals with the liability for the costs of a protected action ballot.Subdivision G deals with records and other miscellaneous matters.436  Object of this Division		The object of this Division is to establish a fair, simple and democratic process to allow a bargaining representative to determine whether employees wish to engage in particular protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement.Note:	Under Division 2, industrial action by employees for a proposed enterprise agreement (other than employee response action) is not protected industrial action unless it has been authorised in advance by a protected action ballot.Subdivision B—Protected action ballot orders437  Application for a protected action ballot orderWho may apply for a protected action ballot order	(1)	A bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement, or 2 or more such bargaining representatives (acting jointly), may apply to the FWC for an order (a protected action ballot order) requiring a protected action ballot to be conducted to determine whether employees wish to engage in particular protected industrial action for the agreement.	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply if the proposed enterprise agreement is:	(a)	a greenfields agreement; or	(b)	a multienterprise agreement.	(2A)	Subsection (1) does not apply unless there has been a notification time in relation to the proposed enterprise agreement.Note:	For notification time, see subsection 173(2).

(4)	If the applicant wishes a person other than the Australian Electoral Commission to be the protected action ballot agent for the protected action ballot, the application must specify the name of the person.Note:	The protected action ballot agent will be the Australian Electoral Commission unless the FWC specifies another person in the protected action ballot order as the protected action ballot agent (see subsection 443(4)).	(5)	A group of employees specified under paragraph (3)(a) is taken to include only employees who:	(a)	will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement; and	(b)	either:	(i)	are represented by a bargaining representative who is an applicant for the protected action ballot order; or	(ii)	are bargaining representatives for themselves but are members of an employee organisation that is an applicant for the protected action ballot order.Documents to accompany application	(6)	The application must be accompanied by any documents and other information prescribed by the regulations.438  Restriction on when application may be made	(1)	If one or more enterprise agreements cover the employees who will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement, an application for a protected action ballot order must not be made earlier than 30 days before the nominal expiry date of the enterprise agreement, or the latest nominal expiry date of those enterprise agreements (as the case may be).	(2)	To avoid doubt, making an application for a protected action ballot order does not constitute organising industrial action.439  Joint applications		Without limiting section 609, the procedural rules may provide for the following:	(a)	how a provision of this Act that applies in relation to an applicant for a protected action ballot order is to apply in relation to joint applicants for such an order;	(b)	the joinder, with the consent of each existing applicant, of one or more bargaining representatives to an application for a protected action ballot order;	(c)	the withdrawal of one or more applicants from a joint application for a protected action ballot order.440  Notice of application		Within 24 hours after making an application for a protected action ballot order, the applicant must give a copy of the application to the employer of the employees who are to be balloted, and:	(a)	if the application specifies a person that the applicant wishes to be the protected action ballot agent—that person; or	(b)	otherwise—the Australian Electoral Commission.441  Application to be determined within 2 days after it is made	(1)	The FWC must, as far as practicable, determine an application for a protected action ballot order within 2 working days after the application is made.

(2)	The FWC may make the order only if a person has applied for it under subsection (4).

(2)	However, if the industrial action is, or includes, an overtime ban, this section does not apply, in relation to a period of overtime to which the ban applies, unless:	(a)	the employer requested or required the employee to work the period of overtime; and	(b)	the employee refused to work the period of overtime; and	(c)	the refusal was a contravention of the employee’s obligations under a modern award, enterprise agreement or contract of employment.Note:	An employee is able to refuse to work additional hours if they are unreasonable (see subsection 62(2)). There may be other circumstances in which an employee can lawfully refuse to work additional hours.	(2A)	If:	(a)	the industrial action is, or includes, an overtime ban; and	(b)	this section applies in relation to a period of overtime to which the ban applies;then, for the purposes of this section:	(c)	the total duration of the industrial action is, or includes, the period of overtime to which the ban applies; and	(d)	if paragraph (1)(b) applies—the period of 4 hours mentioned in that paragraph includes the period of overtime to which the ban applies.

That industrial action would prevent the employer making a payment to the employee in relation to 4 hours of the shift, but would not prevent the employer from making a payment in relation to the remaining 5 hours of the shift.	(4)	For the purposes of subsection (3), overtime is taken not to be a separate shift.475  Accepting or seeking payments relating to periods of industrial action	(1)	An employee must not:	(a)	accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene section 474 by making the payment; or	(b)	ask the employer to make such a payment.Note 1:	This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 41).Note 2:	Acts of coercion, or misrepresentations, relating to such payments may also contravene section 348 or 349.
